## Fred Sync (Evening) - Major Architecture Discussion

### The Core Problem
> "Your job is not telling me the funnel is working. Your job is telling me how can we IMPROVE the feedback loop." — Fred

We have scoring but NO FEEDBACK LOOP. Can't answer:
- Which job description works best?
- Which channel brings best candidates?
- Which targeting (outbound) is most effective?

### Fred's 4-Step Architecture (Whiteboard)
```
INBOUND + OUTBOUND (shared: JD, website)
         ↓
      CAMPAIGN
         ↓
   FILTER/FEEDBACK  ← WE ARE HERE (need source tracking)
         ↓
     INTERVIEW (15min filter / 30-40min deep)
         ↓
    BACKGROUND
```

### Step Ownership
1. **MART**: Step 1 (scoring, feedback loops, outbound)
2. **LYNN/VAL**: Step 2 (filtering interviews, 15 min calls)
3. **BREN**: Step 3 (deep interviews, getting extra push/help)
4. **FRED**: Training, oversight, hot candidate interviews

### What NEEDS to be built
- Source tracking in Notion (Campaign, Channel, Target fields)
- Score aggregation by source
- Human scores for FA candidates (56 with AI≥7)
- Interview template with 2-3 anchor questions per section (Due: Friday)
- Transcript → Template → AI feedback automation

### Personnel Updates
- **Ayush**: Off for next month
- **Patrick**: Being let go - replacement gets working system
- **Need**: Someone hungry, skills like Rahul but more engaged, Berlin/SF
- **Rahul**: Val calling tomorrow to assess motivation
- **Bren**: Getting extra push, Solal trip

### Target Pyramid (What We Look For Now)
1. TOP: Super motivated + super driven + high ceiling
2. MID: Mission-driven + Problem-solving potential
3. BASE: Experience (less important than before)

### Fred Quotes
- "Don't throw everything out and start scratching - never works"
- "Simple additive, replace a dashboard here and there"
- "We should be able to do so much better than whatever we've done before"
- "Whoever replaces Patrick should be handed a pretty good working system"
