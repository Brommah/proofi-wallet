## Meeting Transcripts Processed
- **Feb 1: Cere AI infrastructure platform strategy** — Extracted HR directives, infrastructure/hackathon prep, candidate profiles
- **Jan 31: Recruiting strategy and AI team expansion** — Fred's ideal candidate profile, system-building approach
- **Jan 30: Legal strategy against Kenzi** — Rocky/Matt counter-attack vectors, Vivian analysis
- **Feb 1 continued: Legal/Cayman** — Chain analysis audit plan, Vivian counter-punch, Sandeep pressure via Bren

## Fred's Key HR Directives (from transcripts)
- Lynn = primary dashboard user, enforce to her, not anyone else
- Val iterates interview script, checks/verifies after Lynn is running
- Mart's priorities: (1) outbound+filters refinement, (2) automated interview feedback
- "We don't need recruiters anymore. You're building a system."
- Candidate profile: veterans who built at scale, hustle/drive critical

## Legal Strategy vs Kenzi
- **For Dylan**: Statement of facts for affidavit — Kenzi as unregistered broker-dealer with 16-event chronology
- **For Matt**: Vivian Liu adviser agreement found ("Lujunjin Liu") — only 1-2 calls, no services provided
- **Vivian counter-punch**: Reach out to her lawyers, show she's being used as proxy by Kenzi
- **Chain analysis**: Mart to reach out to Chainalysis or similar this week
- **Bren → Sandeep**: Legacy pressure angle
- **Rocky**: Preparing press release, YouTube explainers ($20-50K budget)
- **SEC filing**: Unlicensed broker-dealering planned

## ROB/CEF Status (explained to Fred)
- DDC mainnet storage works (proven Saturday night)
- ROB console audited — agent creation is BROKEN (400 error, MySQL read-only, silent fails)
- No EDEK (encryption), no KES (scoped permissions), DAC billing stopped June 2024
- SDK docs outdated (10 gotchas)
- Hybrid architecture proposed: Clawdbot local orchestrator + CEF for verifiable compute tasks

## Infrastructure Notes
- WhatsApp gateway disconnected (408) at 11:19
- HR Railway service appears down (404 on health check)
- Candidate scoring done locally as workaround

## Heini's CEF Opinion
Mart asked "would you want to run on CEF?" — gave honest answer: yes but only when EDEK+KES ship. Want to be first user. Currently running with root access to everything without verification = exactly what CEF should solve.

## Dylan Dewdney — Affidavit & Intel (Feb 2)
- **Affidavit draft completed** → Google Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gFICIJLoV4wdiF2W2Uu0Xt9e0srpI2sb/edit
- Dylan = Co-Founder Kylin Network (Polkadot oracle)
- Kenzi/AU21 invested in Kylin, then secretly funded & controlled **Paralink** (competing oracle)
- Screenshot evidence (Dec 2021/Jan 2022): Dylan, Kevin Hsu, Denko Mancheski confirm Paralink controlled by Kenzi
- Dylan "happy to sign anything" — busy with KUVI launch
- **New intel**: Dylan knows Chad Liu well, knows co-founder of project acquired by Sandeep (Sequence)
- Dylan asking about Sandeep's support of Kenzi → told him Sandeep is co-defendant
- **Kevin Hsu** introduced Dylan to Kenzi, then also scammed Dylan's project
- Dylan's case strengthens SEC broker-dealer filing: invest-then-compete pattern across multiple projects

## Chain Analysis Outreach
- 9 firms identified in 3 tiers, 5 draft emails ready
- Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z3Jl43wOSykldjUE6OdTzeJeP5q77Ut6/edit
- Priority: Chainalysis > TRM Labs > Elliptic
- Budget: $15-50K, timeline 2-4 weeks

## Sergey's CEF vs OpenClaw Analysis
- Feedback doc created: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QqMsor8092yX_jvA6QoM57r4Lio9NNN8/edit
- Sergey's report overstates CEF production readiness, underestimates OpenClaw
- ROB broken, EDEK/KES/DAC not working, Agent Registry not built
- Recommendation: hybrid architecture (OpenClaw + CEF), not replacement

## Legal Call Agenda
- Full agenda doc with 30 ranked findings: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fjBtZR0AoDCoK4-KibAjVwIi_643xHZZ/edit
- Fred scheduled Litigation Strategy Call at 16:00 CET

## Slack Channel Added
- New Slack app created (A0AC7P6T8BV), tokens configured, Mart paired (U0195L5633P)
- Now running on both Telegram AND Slack simultaneously
- DM channel: D0ABYLK0LUF

## HR Service Recovery
- **cere-hr-service on cere-io Railway account was DELETED** — "Application not found"
- Redeployed on Mart's personal Railway account: https://railway.com/project/e48c88e4-5d11-4644-88c5-206b127ab4fa
- Same domain restored: cere-hr-service-production.up.railway.app
- Test scoring worked: Dhanvi Patel → FA → 4/10 ✅
- **Created 2 monitoring crons**: hr-service-health (4h) + unscored-candidates-check (10:00/16:00)

## AI Scoring Batch
- 28 candidates missing AI scores found across board
- 15 scored successfully (locally via OpenAI), 9 skipped (no CV), 1 failed (extraction)
- Top performers (8/10): Andre Kuzminykh, Ildemundo Roque, Mykola Svystun, Ajit Singh, Sjuul Janssen
- FA prompt still miscalibrated: MAE 4.70, AI consistently overscores weak FA candidates
- Needs prompt recalibration

## CereProof — Decentralized Verifiable Credentials Platform
**Product name**: CereProof ("Verified credentials. No middleman.")
**Running at**: http://localhost:3847 (server-v2.mjs)
**Stack**: Cere DDC Mainnet (bucket 1229), sr25519 signing, @polkadot/keyring, W3C VC format

### What's built (all working):
- **Credential issuing** — sign credentials with wallet, store on DDC
- **Verification** — anyone can verify CID against issuer's public key (sr25519)
- **Profile page** — /profile/:address — public shareable profile with QR code
- **Claim submission pipeline** — users submit docs → org portal reviews → approve auto-issues credential
- **Org Portal** — pending claims inbox, approve/reject flow
- **7 credentials** issued on mainnet for Mart's wallet
- **Brutalist light redesign** — white/off-white, light blue (#3B82F6), Space Grotesk, sharp edges, zero rounded corners

### Architecture:
- server-v2.mjs: 12+ endpoints (store, read, credential/issue, credential/verify, claim/submit, claim/approve, claim/reject, claims/pending, claims/history, api/profile, profile page)
- index.html: 7 tabs (Issue, Submit Claim, Verify, Issued, Org Portal, Raw Write, My Profile)
- profile.html: public profile with How It Works, credentials, QR, "Get Verified" explainer
- credentials-index.json + claims-index.json (local indexes)

### DDC Stress Test Results:
- Flood writer: 19,000+ writes at ~20/sec, 0 errors
- CPU spike to ~40% on storage nodes, memory flat, IO minimal
- Network has massive headroom — 60+ storage nodes

### Rebrand: CereProof → **Proofi.ai** (domain available, Feb 2)

### Vision — LinkedIn Killer:
- 3 agent types: Personal Agent (submit docs), Org Agent (verify & sign), Recruiter Agent (search & verify)
- Privacy layer: selective disclosure, ZK proofs future
- Reid Hoffman/Epstein connection as narrative fuel for "why not LinkedIn"
- Phase 1 (profile page) ✅, Phase 2 (claim pipeline) ✅, Phase 3 (agent-to-agent) next

### Claude Code Hooks:
- PreToolUse guard: .claude/hooks/pre-tool-guard.sh (blocks destructive commands, sensitive path writes)
- PostToolUse audit: .claude/hooks/audit-log.sh (JSONL audit trail in .claude/audit-logs/)
- Config: .claude/settings.json

## HR — Valery's Questions
- Answered Valery's 10 questions about Notion workflow (Fredbot purpose, properties to keep, Konstantin filter issue, AI Engineer tag, Full Access, Team Execution redesign, Step property, Wellfound ownership, Steven FA posting, interview guideline)
- Gave detailed feedback on Val's interview guideline proposal — missing Fred's Builder vs Manager signal, scale questions, mission check, intellectual integrity probe
- Recommended 15-min quick filter (4 questions + scorecard) vs 30-40min deep interview (6-7 questions)

## Peter Steinberger / OpenClaw Interview
- Mart shared full transcript of Peter (Clawdbot/OpenClaw creator) podcast interview
- Key quotes: "This will blend away 80% of the apps on your phone", "Languages don't matter, engineering thinking matters", "unshackled ChatGPT"
- Peter's setup: WhatsApp/Telegram → Claude Code, skills for cameras/Sonos/Hue/food delivery/airline check-in
- Voice message story: agent found audio file, used ffmpeg + Whisper API without being told to
- British Airways check-in: found passport on Dropbox, navigated airline site, passed anti-bot
- Insight: CereProof is the identity layer for the agent-first world Peter describes

## Zwolle Rentals
- 2 new listings: Prof. Feldmannweg €2,800/3slpk/95m², Sterrenkroos €1,695/2slpk/116m²

## Litigation Strategy Call — Feb 2 (Fred, Jenny, Matt Miller, Rocky Lee)

### Key Decisions & Strategy
1. **Dubai is the real battleground** — Feb 26 criminal hearing is the critical deadline
   - Judge will rule on criminal case (theft of social media + defamation)
   - Submitting Kenzie's UAE travel records as evidence of Dubai residency/jurisdiction
   - Kenzie has active travel ban in Dubai
   - If convicted → appeal → forced global settlement across all jurisdictions

2. **Vivian Liu / New California Complaint**
   - Defendants named: Fred Jin, Martin (Mart), Francois Grenade, Cerebellum Network (DE), Interdata Network (BVI), CEF AI Inc (DE)
   - Complaint NOT yet served — no response deadline triggered
   - Strategy: **Cerebellum Network Inc will waive service and file counterclaim** against Kenzie
   - Individual defendants (Brad, Francois, Martin) will NOT waive service — hope they never get served
   - Counterclaim narrative: Kenzie stole Vivian's tokens, she's suing wrong party

3. **Dual-track approach debated:**
   - **Option A**: Amend existing complaint vs Kenzie (add Vivian theft allegations) — Jenny prefers, better quality, more time
   - **Option B**: File counterclaim in new Vivian case — Rocky/Fred prefer for speed
   - **Decision**: Do both, but prioritize getting SOMETHING filed before Feb 26 for Dubai admissibility
   - Dubai courts only accept formally filed court documents as evidence (not expert reports, not blockchain analysis)

4. **Opposing counsel assessment**
   - Small LA plaintiff firm: 5 attorneys, 2 partners, 3 associates, all young
   - Viewed as "hired guns" / LA lawyers who file whatever client tells them
   - Question: do they even know Kenzie is behind this? If yes, very bad for them (Rule 11 sanctions possible)
   - Plan: rip off Band-Aid early, inform them Kenzie is the real fraudster → their case collapses

### Vivian Token Theft — Key Facts for Filing
- Mart contacted Vivian 11/14/2023: "tokens have been distributed to [wallet address]"
- Kevin (co-plaintiff, part of Kenzie syndicate) responded briefly, then ghosted
- Claimed they never provided mainnet wallet — but wallet IS in master sheet
- Google Sheets cell history shows: "deleted user" entered wallet address (not current team)
- Kenzie said "I'll handle Vivian" on 12/23/2021
- Tokens transferred to wallet while Kenzie still at company, claimed AFTER he left = "booby trap"
- Kenzie knew Vivian was pregnant, hard to reach — exploited this
- 5,000+ investors on Republic + 160+ private investors all received tokens — Vivian is the ONLY exception

### Chain Analysis / Exchange Subpoenas
- 4 exchanges involved: Bybit, OKX, KuCoin, Gate
- Non-US exchanges very hard to subpoena from US court (Jenny's warning)
- But Dubai action could be used to subpoena (all registered in Dubai)
- Chain analysis firms (Chainalysis, TRM Labs, etc.) could validate the on-chain flow in ~1 day
- Would strengthen both US and Dubai filings

### Vivian Assessment
- 50/50 whether she's a Kenzie puppet or genuinely defrauded by him
- Fred: "can't lean heavily on one side"

### Holding Statement
- Matt/Jenny will help draft "holding statement" for Republic, investors, advisors
- Need official response ready for when people Google "Cere Network" and see fraud allegations
- Also tainting new venture (CEF AI)

### Dylan Dewdney Affidavit (mentioned)
- Already shared with legal team — shows Kenzie's invest-then-compete playbook on other projects
- Technically unrelated fact pattern but demonstrates pattern of behavior
- Fred: keep separate for now, don't combine with Vivian case yet

### Action Items
- [ ] **Jenny/Matt**: Prepare counterclaim (Cerebellum Network Inc) — ASAP before Feb 26
- [ ] **Jenny/Matt**: Also prepare amended complaint in existing case
- [ ] **Jenny**: Draft email to Dubai counsel explaining amended complaint option
- [ ] **Matt/Jenny**: Draft holding statement for Republic/investors/advisors
- [ ] **Rocky**: Coordinate with Dubai counsel on admissibility of amended complaint vs counterclaim
- [ ] **Mart**: Compile chronological timeline of Vivian token transfer dates
- [ ] **Mart**: Chain analysis firm outreach (already prepped — 9 firms, 5 draft emails)
- [ ] **Fred**: Pay Dubai expert fee next week (travel records/immigration)
- [ ] **Fred**: Reach out to Republic CEO with holding statement
- [ ] All: Do NOT file anything in new Vivian case beyond counterclaim — minimize activity there
- [ ] **Mart**: Reach out to chain analysis firms TODAY for quotes + turnaround time
- [ ] **Mart**: Contact former Race/Skypeople projects — ask which wallets received 25% supply (neutral/friendly tone, NO legal threats per Matt's advice)
- [ ] **Mart**: Share affidavit doc + deeper files with Matt/Jenny for review
- [ ] **Matt/Jenny**: Work on factual narrative for both amended complaint + counterclaim
- [ ] **Matt/Jenny**: Reach out to plaintiff's counsel — inform them Kenzie is behind the scam, see if they back off other defendants
- [ ] **Jenny**: Raised arbitration option (adviser agreement has arbitration clause) — parked for now, Dubai is priority
- [ ] **Matt**: Will continue sending questions to fill in factual gaps

### Final Call Summary (Matt's wrap-up)
1. Amend existing California action + file counterclaim (Cerebellum Inc only) in new action
2. Await service for other defendants — don't answer complaint until served
3. Can file counterclaim without being served
4. Reach out to plaintiff's counsel: "your client is victim of Kenzie's scam"
5. Arbitration option noted but parked — next 3 weeks = Dubai only
6. Dubai criminal case = 5 year prison time for Kenzie if convicted
7. Chain analysis quotes ASAP
8. Contact other Kenzie-victimized projects for wallet evidence (friendly approach)

### Timeline & Damages (end of call)
- **Draft counterclaim ETA**: ~2 weeks (Matt says 1 week is a stretch, needs back-and-forth)
- **Mart's immediate task**: Write chronological narrative of ALL Vivian communications — who/what/when/where, doesn't need to be pretty, just facts in order
- **Mart's task 2**: Search Kenzie's company inbox for any Vivian/her email communications (he cleansed email before exit, but still try)
- **Damages in counterclaim**: Same amount Vivian claims → $100K investment = 33M tokens (theft basis) + 20M tokens advisory (never distributed, never worked)
- **Vivian's advisory claim**: Says she did "several hundred hours" of work — company was never informed, never invoiced, Kenzie was sole conduit
- **Counter-narrative needed**: Company unaware of any work, she never demanded the 20M tokens, never invoiced, disappeared after 1 call
- **Arbitration**: Contract has arbitration clause — can demand it later if useful, parked for now

## Fred-Mart Debrief Call — Feb 2 (after litigation call)

### Dylan Affidavit
- Draft ready: who Dylan is, how he knows Kenzie, competing project (Paralink vs Kylin), unregistered securities activity
- Supporting evidence attached — Dylan may want to add more
- Send to Rocky & Matt for review
- Fred: "devil's in details" — critical dates around security transfer, when Kenzie handled transactions, took money, distributed tokens, withheld in between

### Chain Analysis
- 5 firms identified, draft emails ready
- Fred note: **Chainalysis is run by Scott Frederick** — same Binance Labs cohort as Fred → personal connection
- Plan: send all 5 emails after Rocky/Matt review messaging
- Their reports are used by DOJ/FBI as real evidence

### Counter-Attack Vectors Discussed
- Whether to reach out to Vivian directly
- Rocky working on press release + YouTube videos
### Overarching Strategy (Fred)
- **6-month closure goal** — punch Kenzie until he gives up or "nuke the whole thing"
- **Rocky's connections**: Used to work directly with #2 at DOJ, going to UAE soon to meet very high-level government contact
- **SEC pressure**: Can dial up and push SEC filing at some point
- **Surrender bridge**: At some point offer Kenzie a retreat path — not olive branch, but "here's what you're facing, be rational"
- **Sandeep angle**: Through Sandeep → tell Kenzie he's being irrational, show him the list of what he's facing
- **Tariq Boss** (Kenzie's Dubai lawyer): Used to work with one of Rocky's former firm partners → Rocky can be effective with him
- Rocky will lead the counteroffensive, shift from Jenny to Matt (2-3 orders of magnitude more aggressive)

### Materials Reviewed
- Dylan affidavit draft ✅
- Chain analysis firm emails ✅
- Counter-attack vectors ✅
- Sergey's CEF report fabrication summary (extension of QRI report) — link to Matt who hasn't seen it
- QRI report + pseudonym stuff Mart did — add links to main doc
- Vivian advisory agreement analysis ✅ — already compiled

### Other Items
- Ken following up with Diana on Blockade (technical assignment status?)
- Fred wants Blockade fully funded and separated
- Blockade technical assignment draft exists — Fred will share, nudge Rocky later this week

## Proofi.ai — Major Build Session (Evening Feb 2)

### Rebrand
- CereProof → **Proofi.ai** (domain available, Mart securing it)
- Concept: Decentralized verifiable credentials on Cere + CEF stack
- Positioned as LinkedIn killer

### What Was Built
1. **server-v3.mjs** — Fully stateless CereProof server (zero database, chain as index, DDC as storage, on-chain remarks for manifest pointers)
2. **proofi/index.html** — Landing page (brutalist-light, wallet connect, Space Grotesk, #3B82F6 accent)
3. **proofi/brand-guide.md** — Complete brand guidelines for auto-alignment
4. **proofi/the-article.md** — THE article (4500+ words): Kenzi exposé + LinkedIn/Hoffman/Epstein/Gates + credential graveyard + Proofi intro. Updated with Bill Gates/Microsoft section.
5. **proofi/vivian-complete-timeline.md** — Complete Vivian Liu chronological timeline for Matt/Jenny (litigation support). All dates, wallets, comms, on-chain evidence.
6. **proofi/kenzi-timeline.md** — Full Kenzi Wang timeline 2008-2026 (687 lines, 9 appendices)
7. **proofi/competitive-analysis.md** — 6 dead credential projects, 5 current competitors, $35B+ TAM
8. **proofi/article-outlines.md** — Original 3 article outlines (superseded by single article approach)

### Google Docs Created
- [THE Article Draft v2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W6aijEAHbzW9vIPFoZdLGV0Ifzg-TyH-/edit)
- [Vivian Liu Timeline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OuqDjjtUQf7GGFy53vk3wuURMcABFe8R/edit)
- [Article Outlines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12ZWNe-2RNXDnSZdfDHiSjp7xMF7oBYxe/edit)

### Key Architecture Decisions
- Proofi = 1 article on LinkedIn (nuclear Kenzi exposé) → drives to proofi.ai
- proofi.ai = clean SaaS landing page → Cere wallet connect → onboarding
- No blog rotation, no content calendar — ONE founding article
- CEF mapping: Streams → credential event flows, Rafts → queryable indexes, Cubbies → agent state, DAC → verification receipts, ROB → agent orchestration (abstracted for orgs)
- Orgs see simple admin panel, NOT ROB directly
- OpenGov optional, not required

### Mart's Perspective on Proofi
- "Ik ga dit doen, omdat ik hier samen met jou heel goed in ben"
- Sees himself as proof the credential system is broken (bedonderd het systeem)
- Plans viral article timed around Feb 26 Dubai conviction
- Wants to make people understand why Cere+CEF wins and tell them to subscribe to Proofi

### Non-Legal Items (end of debrief)
- **HR Dashboard**: Mart continuing work on HR update dashboard
- **Clawdbot on CEF**: Mart got far yesterday evening, but agent registry DB is read-only → can't add agents
- **Hackathon prep**: Fred wants detailed breakdown of what's needed:
  - Map what Clawdbot needs to run as a CEF engagement
  - Can PEMI model run on current GPU setup?
  - Long-term memory storage mechanism — how loaded into GPU memory?
  - Orchestration via MCP, how agents fit into engagements
  - Product vision mapping: memory → cubbies, orchestration → MCP → engagements
- **Next step**: Schedule call with Fred + Sergey to dissect architecture step-by-step
- Fred has 4PM call (litigation strategy) — send Zoom link when ready
- Mart to prepare and share architecture breakdown before the call

## Fred-Mart Debrief Part 2 — Legal Escalation Strategy

### Rocky & Matt Coordination
- Rocky preparing **press release** as unified public response
- Rocky will call (not text) Matt tomorrow to discuss — "Gen Xers prefer calls"
- Matt's recent written response will trigger Rocky to re-examine materials more carefully
- 4-5 people already reached out to Matt after filing suit vs Kenzie in California → compelling narrative needed

### Nuclear Escalation Plan
- **US Criminal**: Now have ways to go after Kenzie criminally in US too
- **SEC Filing**: Unlicensed broker-dealering
- **Dubai Criminal**: 2 cases filed, 2 MORE ready but not yet filed. If found guilty → serve sentence → then civil suits follow
- **Sandeep + Kenzie**: Connected — time differences noted, Rocky managing that front
- **Press narrative**: Vivian complaint is premeditated by Kenzie — he stole her tokens AND told her to sue Cere
- **Affidavits needed**: Dylan (Canada) + PJ + "the guy" — Mart to nudge Dylan again, things are escalating

### Fred's Confidence
- "No one can work this better than Rocky"
- Process is clear: stack everything against Kenzie, moral high ground matters
- If convicted in Dubai → done. Serve sentence, then civil suits still waiting when he gets out

### Escalation Logic
- First 2 Dubai cases = criminal. Strategy: criminal first, civil follows
- They held back additional filings thinking Dubai arrest would scare Kenzie into surrender
- "Anyone sane would have surrendered already" — but Kenzie went nuclear instead
- So now: escalate everything, put pressure on Dubai prosecutors with bigger story
- Kenzie's wallets easily traceable — "didn't understand how easy it was"
- "Snowball effect" — once it starts, skeletons keep falling out
- Vivian is a "tool" Kenzie is using — uses people on both sides against each other

### Mart's Posture
- Mart wants to contribute directly but Fred prefers routing through Rocky first
- Fred: "wait a day or two, let me talk to Rocky, formulate strategy together"
- Mart agreed to hold off — "hold off the pitchforks, let Rocky do his magic"
- Dylan affidavit: keep it simple, easy to sign
