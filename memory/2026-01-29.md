# 2026-01-29 — Kenzi Wang Evidence Day / CoinDesk Crisis

## Major Events

### Kenzi Wang Token Theft — Full On-Chain Evidence Traced
- Mart provided Ethereum wallet `0xb08f79488D335FBc7E0881c78ba341dA1f249f00` as bridge destination for stolen 33.3M CERE tokens
- Full flow verified: Cere mainnet → fake investor wallet `6R1G...rwFu` → intermediary `6SCW...6R4s` → bridge to Polygon → bridge to Ethereum → sold on KuCoin
- **Test transaction pattern**: 33,333 CERE test (Jan 6, 2024), then 33,299,997.97 CERE full amount (Jan 7, 2024)
- All CERE sold on KuCoin deposit `0xB2101F...567b81`
- Same wallet then received from Gate.io: 30.6M RAZE + 5.4M SKYRIM (AU21 portfolio tokens → fingerprints Kenzi)
- Gate.io connection: Chandler Guo (Kenzi's AU21 co-founder) co-founded Gate.io
- IMPORTANT: `0x0d0707963952f2fba59dd06f2b425ace40b492fe` is NOT Kenzi's personal wallet — it's Gate.io's hot wallet. I made this mistake initially, Mart corrected me.

### Documents Created
- `research/kenzi-vivian-token-theft-memo.md` — full legal memo for Rocky Lee (has errors re: Gate.io wallet identification)
- `research/kenzi-bridge-wallet-synopsis.md` — verified synopsis with all tx hashes
- `/tmp/kenzi-final-hyperlinked.md` — clean version with hyperlinks
- Google Docs uploaded multiple times (formatting issues with pandoc bookmarks)
- Final Google Doc: `1WgV-aukuY7alop9COX7s2_DgTFA9oPQx` — hyperlinked, no bookmarks
- `research/kenzi-wang-public-report.md` — sub-agent writing comprehensive public report (in progress)

### CoinDesk Article Crisis
- CoinDesk published "Investors accuse Cere Network of $100M fraud" — one-sided, no comment from Cere
- Calls Fred Jin "ringleader"
- URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/01/29/investors-accuse-cere-network-of-usd100m-fraud-and-token-dump-scheme-in-lawsuit
- Drafted urgent correction DM for CoinDesk
- Drafted lawyer email for Rocky Lee

### Legal Proceedings Overview
1. **Goopal v. Jin Wang** — 3:26-cv-00857 (N.D. Cal.), filed Jan 27, 2026, $100M damages, RICO + 9 counts
2. **Cere v. Kenzi Wang** — separate CA civil action (irregular capital transfers, token diversion, intimidation)
3. **Dubai criminal** — Kenzi arrested, released on bail, passport surrendered, min 5 year jail time
4. **Vijay/Mapleblock** — filed suit, lawyer Sameer Bindra (Khaitan & Co), Dubai/ME jurisdiction
5. **SimulSuit** — planned simultaneous lawsuit

### Key People
- **Rocky Lee** — Milliard Law — Cere's lawyer
- **Tareek** — Dubai-based lawyer handling criminal prosecution
- **Sameer Bindra** — Khaitan & Co — Vijay's lawyer
- **Krishna** — shared Statescan link for intermediary wallet
- **Chandler Guo** — AU21 co-founder, co-founded Gate.io, early BTC miner

### Nuclear Counter Plan
Mart wants full nuclear response: CoinDesk correction, Rocky subpoenas (KuCoin, Gate.io, OKX, ByBit, Binance), public statement, media offensive, crypto twitter thread, exchange notifications, counter-suit strengthening, criminal referrals (FBI/DOJ/SEC), forensic firm (Chainalysis/TRM Labs)

### Sub-agent Status
- `kenzi-public-report` — writing comprehensive public report with ALL evidence, all lawsuits, all case numbers, Dubai details. CRITICAL priority. Save to `research/kenzi-wang-public-report.md`

## Lessons Learned
- Pandoc .docx creates bookmarks in Google Docs — use Lua filter to strip header identifiers
- `0x0d0707...` is Gate.io hot wallet (9,300 ETH, $27M), NOT a personal wallet. Don't confuse exchange infrastructure with personal wallets.
- Statescan is JS-rendered, web_fetch returns empty. Need browser or API.
- Mart types fast with typos — interpret generously
- When Mart says "100% verified" he means it — double-check everything against Etherscan before claiming certainty
