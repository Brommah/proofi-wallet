## Goopal v. Jin — Major Evidence Gathered

### Managed Token Sale Program (CRITICAL EVIDENCE)
- Found the Nov 9, 2021 mass email from investors@cere.network to ALL private investors
- Two options offered: Option A (direct tokens per vesting) or Option B (MM selling + USDC payout, capped at 2x principal)
- Investors actively chose: LD Capital selected MM, Arrington Capital "actively elected Option B" (confirmed by their auditors!)
- USDC distributed back with etherscan proof: Arrington $500K, Bernard Desarnauts $20K, Woodstock $100K, Bixin $200K (pending)
- Average price: $0.142/CERE
- Mart's email to Heather Harde (Arrington): "We have sold your tokens through our market maker at an average price of $0.142/CERE, up to the maximum of 2x your principal"
- Fred corrected: actual aggregate price was $0.142 not $0.147
- This DESTROYS the "$41M theft" narrative — it was a legitimate investor distribution service

### Financial Consolidation Sheet
- Spreadsheet: `1asZzVfCycxvUbfZno16cwZhKY1fodayqacdJ6qn1J3A` ("High Clearance Consolidation Sheet")
- 4 tabs: Summary, Kenzi Payments, Kenzi Custody, MM Report
- Total sold via MM: $41,778,770 | Bought back: $10,775,423 | Net to treasury: $29,915,121
- $7,874,825 returned to investors (29 distributions, all dated Dec 2021 - May 2022)
- $1,045,000 to Mike Chen (mikechen.eth) for MM services
- Kenzi payments: $3,706,014 | Kenzi custody: $572,000 | Total Kenzi: $4,278,014
- Missing funds hidden by Kenzi: ~$1,300,000
- Net diff: $3,412,281 (operational expenses)

### Gotbit Telegram Evidence — "Cere x gotbit NEW" Group
- 7 screenshots analyzed from the NEW group (19 members)
- Timeline: April-May 2022
- Fred was the ONLY Cere person communicating with Gotbit team
- Alex (Gotbit owner) to Fred: "you asked me to fix this situation on your market"
- Fred scheduled the call, received proposals, was asked to set up KuCoin accounts
- Mart ZERO presence — no messages, not on calls, not in planning
- IMPORTANT: Don't incriminate Fred — market making is standard practice, not wash trading

### Counter-Claims Added to Google Doc
- Doc: `1376q3WiqpDV6FZuBfoh88Nhx6pXkAC7EOVO4mHlF7Lg` ("Kenzi claims per emails May 1/2 - May '23")
