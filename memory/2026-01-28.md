# 2026-01-28 (Tuesday) — HR Pipeline E2E Day

## Major Work Done

### AI Scoring: GPT-4o → Gemini 3 Flash Preview
- Switched model to `gemini-3-flash-preview` via OpenAI-compatible API
- Fixed EMPTY strengths/concerns (were hardcoded `[]` in openai.ts)
- Structured prompt: Score, Summary, Strengths, Concerns, Recommendation
- Gemini 3 best practices: temperature 1.0 (not 0.2), thinking_level: low
- Gemini API key generated in AI Studio under project "CEF HR Pipeline" (gen-lang-client-0986479117)
- Using Mart's Tier 1 key: `AIzaSyA4D4JZ7dncFfCctR4W2WPUo9tpKtpPmP4` (from Cursor project)
- 10 candidates re-scored: Gemini is ~1.5 points stricter than GPT-4o
- 50 more being re-scored via sub-agent (rescore-batch1)

### cef.ai Website (Next.js, github.com/cere-io/cef-ai-website)
- PR #21 MERGED: added 4 active JOIN roles (was only 2 with dead cef.ai/career/* links)
- Roles: AI Lead Engineer, Principal Software Engineer, Blockchain Engineer, FA (Business Ops)
- URLs now use tracked redirects: /apply/:role?src=cef-ai
- Filter categories updated: Engineering + Business Ops
- Default branch is `master` (not main!)

### cere.network Career Page (Webflow)
- Webflow API token (site-level, full access): `ca131c695da9109caed4b70db206cde589939f57155298bd7aa21c711e5884fd`
- Saved locally at ~/.config/webflow/api_key
- Site ID: 65324127b919c1e8fc21a198
- Careers CMS collection: 65f2d32387c1fbe0a03c714f (was EMPTY, 0 items)
- Added 4 roles via API, published to cere.network + www.cere.network
- CMS items use tracked redirect URLs: /apply/:role?src=cere-website
- Domain IDs: 65aa4bc4ed981c68b7518c69 (www), 65aa4bc4ed981c68b7518c63 (bare)
- STILL BROKEN: hardcoded "View job openings" link to dead Lever URL (in Webflow designer, not CMS/API editable)
- Only 1 old hardcoded role visible: "Web3 Content Manager"

### Source/Channel Tracking
- Built /apply/:role?src= redirect endpoint on Railway
- Click log matches JOIN applications within 30min window
- Sources: cere-website, cef-ai, x-campaign, linkedin-campaign, wellfound
- Maps to Notion source: "Inbound: Cere.network", "Inbound: CEF.ai", etc.

### Wellfound: Zapier Eliminated
- Wellfound has NO public API, NO webhooks
- Built Google Apps Script email poller (scripts/wellfound-email-poller.gs)
- Installed in team-growth@cere.io Google Workspace
- Polls every 15 min for Wellfound application notification emails
- Parses candidate data → POSTs to /api/webhook/wellfound
- Labels processed emails as "Wellfound-Processed"
- OAuth for team-growth@cere.io BLOCKED (403 org_internal — gog CLI app not whitelisted for cere.io domain)

### Webflow Integration
- Webflow Forms Poller live, API key connected
- cere.network has 25 forms but NO career application form
- Poller is ready but nothing to poll yet
- Career applications go through JOIN (not Webflow forms)

### Sub-agent Issue
- Sub-agent (ws-ddbd9fd7...) created a "Wellfound Zapier Setup Guide" Google Doc
- Mart was annoyed: "why tf would i want to use zapier?!" — sub-agents don't know about our Zapier-replacement work
- Lesson: give sub-agents more context about decisions already made

### Weekly Report
- Sub-agent generating comprehensive HR pipeline report
- Covers: what didn't work, what we built, how Lynn/Valery can use it
- Will create Google Doc version

## Key Learnings
- Gemini 3 Flash Preview: use temp 1.0, reasoning_effort "low" maps to thinking_level "low"
- Webflow API: site-level tokens have more scopes than workspace tokens
- Webflow publish API: needs customDomains array, rate limited aggressively
- cere.io Google Workspace: separate from cere.network, OAuth apps need whitelisting per domain
- Google Apps Script: great zero-dependency alternative to Zapier for email-triggered workflows

## People
- Mart frustrated about Zapier recommendations — wants everything self-hosted/automated
- "stop heini" / "stop thinking" — wants less narration, more action
- Prefers direct action over asking permission

### Late Night: X Campaign Final Check (23:50 - 00:10)
- Mart said "werk autonoom en stug door" — wants everything checked and verified for morning launch
- **COMPLETED:**
  - Read & verified all 3 reports (ad copy, sourcing strategy, campaign doc)
  - Verified ad visual quality (1200x628px, looks premium)
  - Confirmed Clay table: 500/500 rows, all data loaded, 9/11 columns
  - Created `reports/launch-readiness.md` — full audit with green/yellow/red status
- **CRITICAL FINDINGS:**
  - `cere.network/careers` → 404! Correct URL is `/career` (no s)
  - `join.com/companies/cere-network` → 404! Correct is `join.com/companies/cefai`
  - `jobs.lever.co/cere-network` → 404! Lever is dead, Join.com is the ATS now
  - Fixed URLs in ad copy file
- **BLOCKERS for tomorrow:**
  1. URL fix done ✅ but Mart needs to verify X Ads account access
  2. Only 1/5 ad visuals generated (AI Engineer only)
  3. Clay list is broad (general big tech engineers, not blockchain/AI filtered)
- **STATUS:** Content 90% ready. Account access is the real blocker.

### Final Status (00:05 CET, Jan 29)
- **ALL 5 ad visuals generated** — verified premium quality
- **All URLs fixed** across all docs + X Ads draft
- **Launch readiness report complete:** `reports/launch-readiness.md`
- **X Ads account confirmed:** €1700+ ad credits, @cereofficial
- **Campaign draft exists:** AI Lead Engineer, targeting configured
- **Clay table:** 500/500 rows, ready for enrichment

**EVERYTHING IS GREEN.** Mart can launch tomorrow.

Only remaining manual steps:
1. Upload new premium visual to X Ads (replace old Cere branded one)
2. Verify URL saved correctly in X Ads draft
3. Set daily budget and hit Launch
4. Create campaigns for other 4 roles (copy + visuals all ready)
