# 2026-02-08 - Massive Proofi Build Day

## Summary
Huge Proofi development session with Mart. Built out CLI, mobile, web demo, and documentation.

## Key Accomplishments

### CLI - Complete FTUE
- Added BIP39 recovery phrase generation
- Simplified `proofi init` - one command does everything
- Added commands: `scopes`, `audit`, `logs`, `insights`, `revoke`, `tokens`
- **Real DDC integration** - uploads to Cere DDC mainnet (not local storage!)
- Interactive scope selector with sensitivity levels (LOW/MED/HIGH)
- Beautiful output with step counters, boxes, timing

### Web Demo (real-demo.html)
- Removed ALL IndexedDB fallback - **DDC OR NOTHING**
- Direct DDC upload via SDK (bypassing Railway API)
- Working on Apple-style redesign (light theme, no icons)
- Adding granular permissions UI with 3 agent choices

### Mobile
- Fixed proofi-mobile with 74 tests
- AES-256-GCM encryption (replaced XOR)
- Working on E2E flow for mobile browser

### Documentation
- ZERO-TO-DEPLOY.md guide
- Security audit completed (found debug-env.js leak - fixed)
- CLI mockup at `/cli-mockup.html`
- Health insights UI at `/health-insights/insights-ui.html`

## Important Technical Details

### DDC Bucket
- Bucket 1229 is used
- Wallet: `5DSxCBjQZ6P9fu2a34Gn9Ae6aJLMaiHJhveMTiMDCVCoazE1`
- DAC not on mainnet yet = free uploads (no gas costs)

### URLs (Vercel only!)
- `proofi-virid.vercel.app/app` - Mobile wallet
- `proofi-virid.vercel.app/demo-health/real-demo.html` - Health demo
- `proofi-virid.vercel.app/health-insights/insights-ui.html` - Insights UI
- Do NOT use proofi.ai links yet

### Key Mart Preferences
- "DDC OR NOTHING" - never fall back to local storage
- "No icons, Apple-style minimalism"
- "Granular permissions with specific agents is the porno"
- Default to mainnet, not testnet

## Active Work (agents running at session end)
- granular-permissions: Adding scope selector + 3 agents to demo
- mobile-e2e: Making full E2E flow work on mobile browser

## Repos
