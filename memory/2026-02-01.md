# 2026-02-01 — Kenzi Wang Deep Research Marathon

## Context
Mart asked for exhaustive deep research on Kenzi Wang to find all incriminating evidence beyond what was in the existing report (`research/kenzi-wang-public-report.md` from Jan 29).

## Research Conducted
- 3 sub-agent research rounds spawned + my own parallel searching
- Used dzhng/deep-research GitHub tool attempt (failed — needs Firecrawl API key we don't have)
- Total: 4 research files produced

## Files Created
1. `research/kenzi-deep-research-new-findings.md` — Round 1 (20 findings)
2. `research/kenzi-deep-research-round2.md` — Round 2 (23 findings)
3. `research/kenzi-deep-research-round3.md` — Round 3 (10+ findings)
4. `research/kenzi-final-consolidated-report.md` — **FINAL 39KB consolidated report, 11 sections, fully sourced**

## Key NEW Discoveries (not in original Jan 29 report)
### Legal
- **Interdata Network v. Wang, Nailwal, Hu** (3:25-cv-03798, N.D. Cal., May 2025) — Sandeep Nailwal is a named DEFENDANT alongside Kenzi, same defense attorney. ACTIVE case.
- Bridge wallet sent to 4 exchanges: KuCoin, Gate.io, OKX, ByBit (all subpoena-able)
- Wallet 0x0d07... is Gate.io hot wallet (labeled "Gate.io 1" on Etherscan), NOT a personal wallet — important forensic clarification

### Fabrications
- **Wikitia page was PAID creation** by "Ankush.srg" marketing service on July 31, 2025 — 6 months before lawsuits
- **5 fabricated references** on Wikitia (TechCrunch x2, BusinessInsider, CoinDesk, Forbes — all 404)

- **Traction Labs "acquisition" is fabricated** — TechCrunch reference URL is 404, Reddit says marketplace died by 2015
- **4 different Columbia majors** across platforms (Computer Science, Mathematics, Mathematical Sciences, Math+Finance)
- **hadron.cloud CEO claim is fake** — Cliff Szu was the real CEO
- **CypherHunter falsely lists him as "GP at a16z crypto"**
- Claims Tesla/SpaceX/Perplexity investments — only on fabricated Wikitia

### $ELE Meme Coin Scandal
- Kenzi + Polygon insiders orchestrated $ELE pump-and-dump (May 2024)
- Market cap crashed $17M → $2M

### Relationships & Conflicts
- **Sachi Kamiya** (fiancée/wife) works at Polygon Ventures + Symbolic Capital + now Sentient — massive COI
- Fred Jin was CEO of Bitlearn in 2018 when Kenzi joined as advisor — relationship predates Cere
- Alexi Nedeltchev (Buzzstarter co-founder) → AU21 partner → managed $21M Polygon fund
- Symbolic Capital = renamed Hyperedge Capital
