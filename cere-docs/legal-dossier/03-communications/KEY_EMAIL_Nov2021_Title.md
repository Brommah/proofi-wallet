Thread: "Welcome to Cere!" - Fred Jin to Xin Jin (CC Martijn)

## CRITICAL QUOTE - Martijn's Own Words:
> "Hi Xin, Nice to meet you! I'm Martijn, **Head of Marketing** at Cere."

## Significance:
- Martijn identifies his own title as "Head of Marketing" - NOT "Chief Marketing Officer (CMO)"
- CMO is a C-level executive title implying corporate officer status
- "Head of Marketing" is a department lead role, NOT a corporate officer
- This directly contradicts the lawsuit allegations

## Additional Context from Same Email:
Fred instructs Xin to "sync up with @martijn" - showing Fred directing work assignments, not Martijn having independent authority.

## Lawsuit Claim vs. Reality:
| Lawsuit Claims | Martijn's Own Words (2021) |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| "Chief Marketing Officer (CMO)" | "Head of Marketing" |
| Corporate Officer | Department Lead |
| C-Suite Executive | Staff Position |
