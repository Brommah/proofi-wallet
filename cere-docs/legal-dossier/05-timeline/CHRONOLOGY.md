## TIMELINE ANALYSIS

**Pattern:** Throughout 2020-2024, all corporate documents show:
1. Martijn's actual role: developer/head of marketing
2. Corporate authority: resided solely with Fred Jin (CEO)
3. Board composition: Fred, Brad, Francois - never included Martijn
4. Signing authority: explicitly denied to Martijn in contract

**Conclusion:** Lawsuit allegations of "CMO/director/signatory" status are contradicted by contemporaneous corporate records.
