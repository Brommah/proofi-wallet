- Title: "CEREBELLUM NETWORK INC - ACTION BY UNANIMOUS WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS"
- Date: February 8, 2024

## BOARD OF DIRECTORS (as per document):

| Role | Name |
|------|------|
| Chief Executive Officer & President | Fred Jin |
| Board member 2 | Brad Bao |
| Board Member 3 | Francois Granade |

## KEY FINDING:
**MARTIJN BROERSMA IS NOT LISTED AS A BOARD MEMBER OR OFFICER**

## Significance:
The lawsuits claim Martijn was a "director" or "officer" for purposes of:
1. Delaware personal jurisdiction (10 Del. C. § 3114)
2. Breach of fiduciary duty claims
3. Signatory authority

This official corporate document proves:
- ❌ Martijn was NOT a director
- ❌ Martijn was NOT an officer
- ❌ Martijn had NO corporate authority
- ✅ Only Fred Jin had signatory authority as CEO

## Note on Document Circulation:
Martijn sent the SignRequest (administrative function), but did NOT sign AS a director.
Facilitating document circulation ≠ corporate officer status.

## Lawsuit Claim vs. Evidence:
| Wang/Goopal Allegation | Corporate Record |
|------------------------|------------------|
| "Director" | NOT on board |
| "CMO/Officer" | NOT listed as officer |
| "Signatory authority" | Only CEO authorized |
