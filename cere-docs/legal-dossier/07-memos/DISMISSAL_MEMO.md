# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Legal Counsel
**FROM:** Paralegal / Case Support
**DATE:** January 28, 2026
**RE:** Motion to Dismiss - Martijn Broersma
       Wang v. Cerebellum Network (Del. Ch. 2026-0054)
       Goopal v. Jin (N.D. Cal. 2026)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Both lawsuits fundamentally mischaracterize Martijn Broersma's role at Cerebellum Network/Cere. The plaintiffs allege he served as "Chief Marketing Officer," "director," and "signatory" with corporate authority. Documentary evidence proves these allegations are false.

**Recommendation:** File motion to dismiss for:
1. Lack of personal jurisdiction (Delaware) - not a director/officer
2. Failure to state a claim - no fiduciary duty owed by non-officers
3. Improper party - wrong defendant based on mistaken identity/role

---

## EVIDENCE SUMMARY

### 1. CONSULTING AGREEMENT (Aug 20, 2020)

**Document:** Cerebellum Network - Consulting Agreement Martijn.docx

**Critical Provisions:**

> **Exhibit A - Services:** "Perform full-time duties as a **senior/lead developer** on cere network software services and platforms."

> **Section 7.A:** "Consultant is **not authorized to bind the Company** to any liability or obligation or to represent that Consultant has any such authority."

> **Status:** "Independent contractor" - explicitly NOT an employee, officer, or director

**Significance:** The only written agreement defining Broersma's role establishes him as a developer with zero corporate authority.

---

### 2. INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS (Nov 16, 2021)

**Document:** Email ID 17d2925b21887b37

**Quote from Martijn Broersma:**
> "I'm Martijn, **Head of Marketing** at Cere."

**Significance:** 
- "Head of Marketing" ≠ "Chief Marketing Officer (CMO)"
- CMO is a C-level officer title implying corporate governance role
- "Head of" is a department lead designation without officer status
- Broersma's own contemporaneous description contradicts lawsuit allegations

---

### 3. BOARD OF DIRECTORS COMPOSITION (Feb 8, 2024)

**Document:** Board_Consent_Feb2024.pdf - "ACTION BY UNANIMOUS WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS"

**Board Members Listed:**
| Title | Name |
|-------|------|
| CEO & President | Fred Jin |
| Board Member 2 | Brad Bao |
| Board Member 3 | Francois Granade |

**Officers Elected:** Only Fred Jin designated with signing authority

**Critical Finding:** **Martijn Broersma is NOT listed** as a director or officer.

## LEGAL ARGUMENTS

### A. Delaware Personal Jurisdiction (Wang Case)

Plaintiffs invoke 10 Del. C. § 3114(a) and (b) for jurisdiction over "current or former directors and/or officers."

**Counter:** Broersma was never a director or officer. His only contractual relationship was as an independent contractor/developer. Delaware's director/officer long-arm statute does not apply.

### B. Breach of Fiduciary Duty Claims

Plaintiffs allege breach of fiduciary duty.

**Counter:** Under Delaware law, fiduciary duties run from directors and officers to the corporation and shareholders. An independent contractor owes no fiduciary duties. See *Guth v. Loft, Inc.*, 5 A.2d 503 (Del. 1939).

### C. "Upon Information and Belief" Pleading Standard

Both complaints plead Broersma's role "upon information and belief."

**Counter:** Plaintiffs' "information and belief" is contradicted by actual corporate records. The Consulting Agreement and Board Consent are dispositive evidence of Broersma's actual role.

## RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

1. **Obtain Delaware SOS filing** - Certificate of Incorporation showing officers/directors
2. **Subpoena Cere corporate records** - All board minutes, officer appointments
3. **Depose Fred Jin** - Confirm Broersma was never appointed director/officer
4. **File Motion to Dismiss** - Lack of jurisdiction + failure to state claim
5. **Request sanctions** - Plaintiffs' counsel failed to verify factual basis for naming Broersma

---

## CONCLUSION

The documentary evidence unambiguously establishes that Martijn Broersma:
- Was a **developer/contractor**, not an executive
- Had **no signing authority** per his contract
- Was **never appointed** as director or officer
- Is **improperly named** in both lawsuits

The claims against him should be dismissed.
