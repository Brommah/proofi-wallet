# DRAFT AFFIDAVIT — DYLAN DEWDNEY
## Re: Kenzi Wang / AU21 Capital — Unregistered Securities Activity

**CONFIDENTIAL — DRAFT FOR REVIEW**

---

### DECLARATION OF DYLAN DEWDNEY

I, Dylan Dewdney, hereby declare under penalty of perjury that the following statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief:

---

### 1. BACKGROUND AND QUALIFICATIONS

1. I am the Co-Founder and CEO of Kylin Network, a cross-chain data oracle protocol built on the Polkadot/Substrate framework. I have been active in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry since 2012, with experience in Bitcoin (Class of 2012) and Ethereum (Class of 2014).

2. Prior to Kylin Network, I co-founded Harbour DAO, served as Head of Growth for AdEx Network, and served as Chief Evangelist and GTM lead for Beam.mw. I have extensive experience in token-based projects and decentralized finance.

---

### 2. INTRODUCTION TO KENZI WANG AND AU21 CAPITAL

3. I was introduced to Kenzi Wang ("Wang") through Kevin Hsu ("Hsu"). At the time, Wang was the co-founder and General Partner of AU21 Capital, a hybrid hedge/venture fund he co-founded with Chandler Guo in 2017, based in San Francisco.

4. Wang had previously served as Vice President and General Manager at Huobi Global, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, where he oversaw operations, business development, marketing, venture investments, and token listing functions.

5. AU21 Capital participated as a seed investor in Kylin Network. Other seed round investors included Digital Strategies, Signum Capital, PNYX Ventures, Moonrock Capital, CMS Holdings, ZMT Capital, Tenzor Capital, and Rarestone Capital.

---

### 3. AU21 CAPITAL'S INVESTMENT IN COMPETING PROJECT

6. While AU21 Capital was an investor in Kylin Network, I discovered that AU21 Capital and/or Kenzi Wang simultaneously invested in and funded **Paralink Network** — a directly competing cross-chain oracle protocol also built on the Polkadot ecosystem.

7. Paralink Network raised approximately $3.1 million across multiple funding rounds, culminating in a public token sale (IDO) on Polkastarter on or about April 2, 2021. The PARA token was priced at $0.02 in its public sale.

8. A February 2021 announcement by Polkastarter confirming AU21 Capital's membership in the Polkastarter Council explicitly listed **Paralink** among AU21's "most recent investments," alongside Litentry, Daomaker, Nsure, Reef, Bridge Mutual, Xend, Tidal, Plasm, and The Graph.

9. AU21 Capital therefore invested in two directly competing Polkadot oracle projects simultaneously — Kylin Network and Paralink Network — without disclosing this conflict of interest to Kylin Network or its stakeholders.

---

### 4. KENZI WANG'S CONTROL OVER PARALINK NETWORK

10. I have direct evidence, including Telegram group communications from approximately December 2021 through January 2022, in which myself, Kevin Hsu, and Denko Mancheski discussed and confirmed that **Paralink Network was controlled by Kenzi Wang**.

11. This evidence demonstrates that Wang was not merely a passive investor in Paralink Network, but was actively involved in controlling and directing the competing project while simultaneously holding an investment position in Kylin Network.

12. [PLACEHOLDER — Dylan to add specific details about how he learned Kenzi controlled Paralink, and any additional communications or evidence]

---

### 5. ACTIVE INTERFERENCE WITH KYLIN NETWORK

13. After investing in Kylin Network through AU21 Capital, Kenzi Wang actively worked against Kylin Network's interests. This included [PLACEHOLDER — Dylan to provide specific examples of sabotage, interference, or actions taken against Kylin].

14. This pattern of investing in a project while simultaneously funding and controlling a competing project, and then actively working against the original investment, is consistent with a scheme to manipulate the market for unregistered digital asset securities.

---

### 6. PATTERN OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES ACTIVITY

15. Based on my experience and observations, Kenzi Wang, through AU21 Capital and its affiliated entities, systematically engaged in the solicitation, sale, distribution, and handling of digital asset securities — including tokens such as KYL (Kylin Network) and PARA (Paralink Network) — without being registered as a broker-dealer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or any other applicable regulatory body.

16. AU21 Capital's business model consisted of: (a) investing in early-stage token projects through private funding rounds; (b) facilitating token listings on exchanges leveraging Wang's prior relationships at Huobi and other platforms; (c) participating in token generation events and initial DEX offerings; and (d) distributing tokens to investors — all activities characteristic of broker-dealer operations.

17. To my knowledge, neither AU21 Capital nor Kenzi Wang was registered with the SEC as a broker-dealer, nor were they associated with a registered broker-dealer, at any time during these activities.

---

### 7. KEVIN HSU CONNECTION

18. Kevin Hsu, who introduced me to Kenzi Wang, subsequently engaged in conduct that was harmful to my business interests. [PLACEHOLDER — Dylan to add details about Kevin Hsu's actions if he wishes to include this]

19. The relationship between Wang and Hsu, and their pattern of introductions to token project founders, is consistent with a network of individuals engaged in unregistered securities brokering and dealing.

---

- **Exhibit A:** Telegram group chat screenshot (December 2021 – January 2022) showing communications between Dylan Dewdney, Kevin Hsu, and Denko Mancheski confirming Kenzi Wang's control over Paralink Network.
