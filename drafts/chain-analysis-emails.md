## EMAIL 1 — CHAINALYSIS

**To:** investigations@chainalysis.com / [Contact form](https://www.chainalysis.com/contact-us/)
**Subject:** Forensic Investigation — Multi-Chain Token Theft & Unlicensed Broker-Dealer Activity

Dear Chainalysis Investigations Team,

I'm reaching out on behalf of Cere Network (Cerebellum Networks Inc.) regarding an active civil and criminal case involving the theft and misappropriation of digital assets by a former co-founder.

**Summary:**
We have an ongoing case in both US federal court (N.D. California) and Dubai involving approximately $4.8M+ in diverted funds and 33.3M CERE tokens that were stolen through a fake investor wallet, bridged across chains (Cere → Polygon → Ethereum), and liquidated on KuCoin. The suspect's personal wallet directly funded the bridge wallet with ETH gas fees — we have verified transaction hashes for the complete flow.

**What we need:**
1. Independent forensic verification of our existing on-chain analysis (wallet linkage, fund flow, exchange deposits)
2. A professional report suitable for court submission in US federal and UAE jurisdictions
3. Identification of any additional wallets or fund flows we may have missed
4. Exchange subpoena support (KuCoin, OKX, ByBit)

**Chains:** Cere mainnet, Polygon, Ethereum
**Scope:** ~6 key wallets, bridge transactions (Jan 2024), ongoing token sales (Jan 2026)

We already have verified transaction hashes, wallet addresses, and a preliminary forensic audit. We're looking for an authoritative third-party verification that carries weight in court.

Could you provide a quote and estimated timeline for this scope? We're working with legal counsel and looking to engage a firm within the next 1-2 weeks.

Happy to share the existing evidence package on a call.

Best regards,
Martijn Broersma

## RECOMMENDED APPROACH

1. **Send all 5 emails today** — cast a wide net, fastest response wins
2. **Priority:** Chainalysis > TRM Labs > Elliptic (most court credibility)
3. **Budget expectation:** $15K-50K for a report of this scope (depends on firm)
4. **Timeline:** Most firms can deliver initial report in 2-4 weeks
5. **Ask Rocky** if he has existing relationships with any of these firms — lawyers often have preferred vendors
