### 1. Cold Outreach - Investor

**Subject:** `[COMPANY_NAME]: [ONE_LINE_HOOK]`

**Body:**
```
Hi [FIRST_NAME],

[PERSONALIZED_OPENER_ABOUT_THEIR_PORTFOLIO_OR_RECENT_ACTIVITY].

I'm [YOUR_NAME], founder of [COMPANY_NAME]. We're [ONE_SENTENCE_DESCRIPTION].

In [TIMEFRAME], we've [KEY_TRACTION_METRIC]. We're raising [ROUND_SIZE] to [PRIMARY_USE_OF_FUNDS].

Would you have 20 minutes [SPECIFIC_DATE_RANGE] to explore if there's a fit?

Best,
[YOUR_NAME]
[LINKEDIN_URL]
```

**When to use:** First contact with a potential investor who hasn't heard of you.

**Tips:**
- Research their portfolio — reference a relevant investment they made
- One traction metric beats five vanity metrics
- Keep under 150 words
- Subject line should intrigue, not explain everything

---

### 2. Cold Outreach - Enterprise Prospect

**Subject:** `[THEIR_COMPANY] + [YOUR_COMPANY]: [SPECIFIC_BENEFIT]`

**Body:**
```
Hi [FIRST_NAME],

[OBSERVATION_ABOUT_THEIR_BUSINESS_OR_RECENT_NEWS].

At [YOUR_COMPANY], we help [THEIR_TYPE_OF_COMPANY] [ACHIEVE_SPECIFIC_OUTCOME]. [CUSTOMER_SIMILAR_TO_THEM] saw [SPECIFIC_RESULT] within [TIMEFRAME].

I have a few ideas on how [THEIR_COMPANY] could [SPECIFIC_BENEFIT]. Worth a 15-minute call?

[YOUR_NAME]
[YOUR_TITLE], [YOUR_COMPANY]
```

**When to use:** Prospecting into enterprise accounts without a warm intro.

**Tips:**
- Lead with THEIR world, not yours
- Specific numbers > vague promises ("47% reduction" beats "significant improvement")
- Reference a customer they'd recognize or respect
- Ask for 15 minutes, not 30 — lower commitment = higher conversion

---

### 3. Cold Outreach - Partnership

**Subject:** `Partnership idea: [YOUR_COMPANY] × [THEIR_COMPANY]`

**Body:**
```
Hi [FIRST_NAME],

I've been following [THEIR_COMPANY]'s work on [SPECIFIC_INITIATIVE] — [GENUINE_COMPLIMENT].

I lead [YOUR_ROLE] at [YOUR_COMPANY]. We [WHAT_YOU_DO] for [YOUR_AUDIENCE].

I see an interesting overlap: [SPECIFIC_PARTNERSHIP_IDEA]. This could help [THEIR_COMPANY] [BENEFIT_TO_THEM] while we [BENEFIT_TO_YOU].

Would you be open to a quick call to explore this?

Best,
[YOUR_NAME]
```

**When to use:** Proposing collaboration, integration, or co-marketing to another company.

**Tips:**
- Lead with THEIR benefit, not yours
- Be specific about the partnership idea — vague "let's partner" emails get ignored
- Show you've done homework on their business
- If possible, offer to do the heavy lifting

---

### 4. Introduction Request

**Subject:** `Intro request: [YOUR_NAME] ↔ [TARGET_NAME]`

**Body:**
```
Hi [CONNECTOR_NAME],

Hope you're doing well! [BRIEF_PERSONAL_NOTE_IF_APPROPRIATE].

I'm reaching out because I'd love an introduction to [TARGET_NAME] at [TARGET_COMPANY]. [WHY_YOU_WANT_TO_CONNECT].

Here's a forwardable blurb if you're comfortable making the intro:

---

Hi [TARGET_FIRST_NAME],

I'd like to introduce you to [YOUR_NAME], [YOUR_TITLE] at [YOUR_COMPANY]. [ONE_SENTENCE_ABOUT_YOU/COMPANY]. [SPECIFIC_REASON_FOR_INTRO].

I thought you two should connect because [MUTUAL_BENEFIT].

---

**Body:**
```
Hi [FIRST_NAME],

Wanted to bump this to the top of your inbox. I know things get busy.

[ONE_NEW_PIECE_OF_INFO_OR_VALUE_ADD — optional].

Still interested in [BRIEF_RESTATE_OF_ASK]?

If the timing isn't right, no worries — just let me know.

[YOUR_NAME]
```

**Tips:**

- Maximum 2-3 follow-ups, then move on

---

### 6. Conference Connection Follow-up

**Subject:** `Great meeting you at [CONFERENCE_NAME]`

**Body:**
```
Hi [FIRST_NAME],

It was great chatting at [CONFERENCE_NAME] [YESTERDAY/ON_DAY]! I enjoyed our conversation about [SPECIFIC_TOPIC_DISCUSSED].

**Attendees needed:** [LIST_OF_PEOPLE]

I'm available:
- [OPTION_1]
- [OPTION_2]
- [OPTION_3]

Or feel free to grab time on my calendar: [CALENDLY_LINK]

[YOUR_NAME]
```

**When to use:** Requesting a meeting with colleagues, especially cross-functional.

**Tips:**
- Always state the goal upfront — people accept meetings they understand
- Propose specific times (reduces back-and-forth)
- Keep attendee list minimal — every extra person = exponentially harder to schedule
- Consider: does this need to be a meeting, or could it be async?

---

**Body:**
```

[YOUR_NAME]
```

---

**Subject:** `[PROJECT_NAME] Update: [WEEK/MONTH] ([STATUS_EMOJI: 🟢/🟡/🔴])`

**Body:**
```
Hi [STAKEHOLDERS],

Here's the [WEEKLY/MONTHLY] update on [PROJECT_NAME].

**Overall status:** [🟢 On track / 🟡 At risk / 🔴 Blocked]

---

### 10. Feedback Request

Thanks!
[YOUR_NAME]
```

**When to use:** Requesting input on work-in-progress from colleagues.

**Tips:**
- Ask SPECIFIC questions — "what do you think?" gets vague answers
- Give a deadline (or it goes to the bottom of the pile)
- Tell them WHY you're asking them specifically
- Make it easy: share a link, not an attachment when possible

---

### 11. Deadline Reminder

**Subject:** `Reminder: [DELIVERABLE] due [DATE]`

**Body:**
```
Hi [NAME],

Quick reminder that [DELIVERABLE] is due [DATE/TOMORROW/EOD].

Really appreciate you!

[YOUR_NAME]
```

**When to use:** When someone goes above and beyond, helps you out, or does excellent work.

**Tips:**
- Be SPECIFIC about what you're thanking them for
- Explain the impact — makes it meaningful, not generic
- CC their manager if appropriate (makes their day)
- Send within 24-48 hours while it's fresh
- Handwritten > email > Slack for impact, but any is good

## 📚 General Tips

1. **Subject lines matter** — 47% of emails are opened based on subject line alone
2. **Front-load the ask** — busy people skim; put the important stuff first
3. **One email, one ask** — multiple asks = none get done
4. **Shorter is better** — aim for under 150 words for cold emails
5. **Proofread** — typos kill credibility, especially in cold outreach
6. **Time it right** — Tuesday-Thursday 9-11am typically gets best response rates
7. **Follow up** — most deals happen after the 5th touch, but know when to stop
8. **Track what works** — A/B test subject lines, CTAs, and timing
