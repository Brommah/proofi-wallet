# Proofi Tokenomics: The Data Economy

> **"Your Data = Your Income"**
> 
> Proofi creates the first decentralized marketplace where users earn from their personal data and AI agents pay for personalized context.

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Proofi introduces a **data economy** built on CERE tokens where:

- **Users** upload personal data (encrypted, self-custodied) and earn passive income
- **AI Agents** pay micropayments to access user data for personalization
- **Platform** facilitates trustless transactions with cryptographic verification

This creates a **flywheel effect**: more users → more valuable data → more agents integrate → more earnings → more users.

## 🛡️ Risk Mitigation

### Sybil Resistance
- Phone/email verification for onboarding rewards

- Agent reputation system (agents rate data quality)
- Low-quality data = fewer queries = less earnings
- Natural market incentive for real data

### Token Price Volatility
- Payments can be denominated in USD equivalent
- Stablecoin settlement option for agents
- User earnings displayed in both CERE and USD
