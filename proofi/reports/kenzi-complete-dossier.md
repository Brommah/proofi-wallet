# 2. PERSONAL BACKGROUND & EDUCATION

## 2.1 — Origin

Per his scholarship website (kenziwang.org), Kenzi describes himself as:

> *"Born in provincial China, the son of a psychiatrist and a neurosurgeon who still lived paycheck-to-paycheck in a planned economy. My first 'lab' was a gray-market PC running pirated DOS."*

No independent verification of this biography exists. No birth date, birth city, or immigration records have been located in public sources.

## 2.2 — Education: Columbia University (FABRICATED / UNVERIFIED)

Kenzi claims to hold a degree from **Columbia University** and an MBA from the **Wharton School of Business** (University of Pennsylvania). However:

1. **His stated Columbia major changes across every platform** — a tell-tale sign of fabrication:

| Platform | Columbia Major Claimed | Year Created |
|----------|----------------------|-------------|
| Wikitia (paid page) | **Computer Science** | July 2025 |
| Everipedia | **Mathematics, Finance, and Financial Management Services** | August 2021 |
| Signal NFX | **Mathematics** | Unknown |
| Bitlearn Medium article | **Mathematics** | April 2018 |
| ContactOut | **Mathematical Sciences** | Unknown |
| Symbolic Capital bio | References "soccer to rugby at Columbia" | 2022 |

2. **Former co-founder Emmie Chang told private investigators** that Wang likely **"lied about graduating from Columbia and Wharton."**

3. **No alumni verification** has been obtained from either institution.

4. **The Everipedia page cites `linkedin.com/in/kwang2`** as its education source — a different LinkedIn URL from his current profile (`linkedin.com/in/kenziwang`), suggesting he created a new account to reset his public history.

5. **Four different descriptions** of the same degree across platforms — Computer Science, Mathematics, Mathematical Sciences, and "Mathematics, Finance, and Financial Management Services" — is strong evidence of fabrication. A real graduate would describe their major consistently.

**Assessment:** Education credentials are almost certainly fabricated. Real education history unknown.

# 5. FRAUD PATTERN & FABRICATED CREDENTIALS

## 5.1 — Modus Operandi (Consistent Across Every Venture)

As described by multiple independent victims:

> *"Tell a big story, get you to sign an agreement, then starts exhausting your positive energy and ultimately shakes you down. Keeps doxxing you and saying 'I'm a cofounder, I have these rights, if you don't send me money I will go after you.'"*
> — **Vijay Garg**, Inclusion Capital

> *"[Kenzi Wang is] the white-collar crypto version of the Tinder Swindler."*
> — **Emmie Chang**, co-founder of SuperBloom

> *"Sharky as fuck"* and *"engaged in strongarm tactics in the past"*
> — **Confidential source**, PI report

> *"Everyone knows Kenzi is awful."*
> — **Emmie Chang**

### The 8-Step Playbook

1. **Present as connected insider** — fabricated credentials, inflated titles, paid PR
2. **Gain trust and access** — join as advisor/co-founder, get control of wallets/accounts
3. **Divert value** — redirect investor funds, insert fake wallet addresses, cut side deals
4. **Evidence destruction** — revoke access, delete files, change passwords
5. **Intimidation when caught** — threatening letters from Singapore law firms, doxxing
6. **DARVO** — Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender — file countersuits accusing victims of exactly what he did
7. **Move on** — rebrand funds, create new entities, start fresh with fabricated history
8. **Repeat** — 7+ fund entities in 8 years, each recycling the same playbook

## 5.2 — Fabricated Credentials Summary

| Claim | Reality | Evidence |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **CEO of hadron.cloud** | **Cliff Szu** was CEO | LinkedIn, CryptoBriefing, Reddit all confirm Cliff Szu |

| **Traction Labs CEO** | Forbes 2014 by co-founder: "growth engineer" | Forbes article by Tiffany Pham |
| **Traction acquired in 2017** | No acquirer named; marketplace died 2015 | TechCrunch reference URL returns 404; Reddit "Why did Traction fail?" |
| **Funded by NEA and Lightbank** | Real investors: China Rock, Telegraph Hill, 500 Startups, Digital Garage, Ullas Naik | TechCrunch (2014), AdExchanger (2015) — zero NEA/Lightbank mentions |

| **Computer Science at Columbia** | Also claims Mathematics, Mathematical Sciences, Math+Finance across platforms | 4 different descriptions = fabrication |
| **Columbia/Wharton graduate** | Emmie Chang: "likely lied about graduating" | PI report testimony |
| **Invested in Tesla, SpaceX, Perplexity, Apptronik** | Only on fabricated Wikitia page | No database confirms |

## 5.3 — Paid Wikitia Propaganda Page (July 2025)

The Kenzi Wang Wikitia page was **created by "Ankush.srg"** on **July 31, 2025** — a professional paid Wikitia page creation service operator whose user page states: *"If you are looking for a page on Wikitia, you can reach out to us on https://page.wikitia.com/"*

Created **6 months before the RICO lawsuit** — preemptive reputation management.

### 5+ Fabricated References Embedded in the Page

- Never remitted to company

- OffshoreAlert: describes Wang as "a resident of Dubai and a former advisor and independent contractor"

## 6.4 — Vivian Liu Token Theft (33.3M CERE)

### The Setup (December 2021)

- **Dec 23, 2021**: Kenzi states in Slack: *"I'll handle Vivian" / "I'll take Vivian and Jacky"*
- Becomes sole intermediary between Cere and Vivian Liu
- Reports back: Vivian "showed up, didn't sign new docs, said she got pregnant and had a baby, but wants all tokens staked"
- Exploits Vivian being pregnant and hard to reach to delay any inquiry

### The Fake Wallet (Late 2021 – Early 2022)

- A wallet address appears in the distribution mastersheet that **Vivian Liu never provided**:
  - Substrate: `5DZMJ4GD8MDhp2Pxsri3ysqRqoE3KfsSGE7zMgGDVngbUrwv`
  - Cere mainnet: `6R1GPxm3jqiRgjFXkFGLWh2XbcwZysRgXWmZjsyq43pSrwFu`
- Google Sheets cell history shows: **"deleted user"** entered the wallet address — not any current team member
- Only 5 people had write access: AK, AN, Sieb, Fred, Martijn
- AK's Google Workspace data was deleted after 20-day retention period
- **Martijn confirmed**: *"The address was never shared by the investor, already checked everything"*

### Token Distribution (March–May 2022)

| Date | Amount | From (Company Wallet) | To (Fake Wallet) | Block |
|------|--------|----------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Mar 25, 2022 | 13,333,334 CERE | `6Rz7GYaWj5mY7zSFp2aNpXcPP7LkhuMr8E8g62j5mHKEYRbS` | `6R1GPxm3jqiRgjFXkFGLWh2XbcwZysRgXWmZjsyq43pSrwFu` | 4,222,827 |
| May 10, 2022 | 20,000,000 CERE | `6RtDT7L4rK9L7BRE78gPLEx1Dw5mvrXfhZMfPWx3bf2ib2sb` | Same fake wallet | 5,019,196 |
| **Total** | **33,333,334 CERE** | | | |

### The Immediate Drainage (~8 Hours After)

Entire balance drained in test-then-sweep pattern to intermediary wallet `6SCW2o71hKeWyNY2eBnti7QF2o1TG98BCuj7Fi9Fz23r6R4s`:

1. **2 CERE** — test transaction
2. **~3,333,334 CERE** — first sweep
3. **30,000,000 CERE** — main sweep
4. **1 CERE** — dust cleanup

Intermediary then forwarded **entire 33,333,334 CERE** back to Company Wallet A (`6Rz7...YRBS`) — the same wallet that originated the first distribution. **Full circle.** Vivian received nothing.

### Bridge to Ethereum & KuCoin Cash-Out (January 2024)

Tokens bridged: Cere mainnet → Polygon → Ethereum via Polygon ERC20 Bridge.

**Bridge arrivals** in wallet `0xb08f79488D335FBc7E0881c78ba341dA1f249f00`:

| Date | Amount | TX Hash | Block |
|------|--------|---------|-------|
| Jan 6, 2024 | 33,333 CERE (test) | `0xd8f9cbad...` | 18948883 |
| Jan 7, 2024 | 33,299,997.97 CERE (full) | `0x7e4fd0db...` | 18956606 |

**Immediate KuCoin sales** (same day):

| Date | Amount | TX Hash | Block |
|------|--------|---------|-------|
| Jan 6, 2024 | 33,333 CERE → KuCoin | `0xcfe4dca1...` | 18948896 |
| Jan 7, 2024 | 33,299,997.97 CERE → KuCoin | `0x0e2d9f46...` | 18956627 |

**Total cashed out on KuCoin: 33,333,330.97 CERE** — Vivian's full allocation.

### The AU21 Portfolio Fingerprint (January 31, 2024)

Same bridge wallet received from Gate.io (Chandler Guo's exchange):
- **5,376,609.47 SKYRIM** — TX: `0xc110c4b5...` (Block 19125392)
- **30,600,560.93 RAZE** — TX: `0x5b3f8dba...` (Block 19125397)

Both RAZE and SKYRIM are **AU21 Capital portfolio companies** — niche DeFi tokens that fingerprint Kenzi Wang:
- AU21 was funding partner for Raze Network (April 2021)
- AU21 participated in Skyrim Finance's $2.1M round (May 2021)

**No other entity would have**: (a) access to steal Vivian's CERE, (b) a Gate.io account with massive AU21 portfolio holdings, and (c) the operational sophistication for cross-chain bridges and multi-exchange liquidation.

### Systematic Liquidation (February 2024)

All RAZE and SKYRIM tokens systematically sold through Gate.io:
- 30.6M RAZE sold in 11+ transactions (Feb 1–24, 2024)
- 5.37M SKYRIM sold in 2 transactions (Feb 1, 2024)
- ETH residuals sent to OKX and ByBit
- Bridge wallet fully drained to **$0.04** by July 7, 2024

### Forensic Note: Gate.io Hot Wallet

Wallet `0x0d0707963952f2fba59dd06f2b425ace40b492fe` is labeled on Etherscan as **"Gate.io 1"** — a Gate.io exchange hot wallet with 10.9M transactions and $759M balance across 31 chains. The CERE/RAZE/SKYRIM holdings are exchange-custodied assets. A **Gate.io subpoena** would identify which KYC-verified account made the specific withdrawals to the bridge wallet.

## 6.5 — The DARVO Counter-Narrative

~January 2026: Kenzi files **$58M Delaware countersuit** (Wang v. Cerebellum Network et al., Delaware Court of Chancery), claiming Fred Jin diverted Cere token assets — accusing Jin of **exactly what Kenzi himself did**.

The **Practus LLP investigation** (Mar–Jul 2024) found the opposite:
> *"No evidence to support Wang's allegations regarding Fred Jin's misappropriation of Company funds."*

Both Fred Jin and Martijn Broersma were found credible in interviews. Classic DARVO — Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender.

## 6.6 — Evidence Destruction Campaign

- Revoked company access to Token Sale Tracker spreadsheet
- Deleted or removed access to additional company files
- AK's Google Workspace data deleted after 20-day retention period
- "Deleted users" appear in distribution sheet where wallet addresses were entered
- Evgeny Svirsky (Fireblocks co-signer) denied authorizing transfers: *"I didn't sign anything. Nobody has my private keys."*

|-------------|-------|-------|---------|--------|
| **4:23-cv-02444** | N.D. Cal. | May 19, 2023 | Cerebellum Networks v. Wang | Active — $1.3M theft |
| **3:25-cv-03798** | N.D. Cal. | May 1, 2025 | Interdata Network v. Wang, **Nailwal**, Hu | Active — Judge James Donato |

### Key Detail: Case 3:25-cv-03798 (Interdata v. Wang, Nailwal, Hu)

- **Sandeep Nailwal is a named DEFENDANT** alongside Kenzi
- **Both share the SAME defense attorney**: David Allen Sergenian, Sergenian Law, Los Angeles (2355 Westwood Blvd., Suite 529, LA 90064)
- Jun 27, 2025: Kenzi filed **Anti-SLAPP motion** to strike + motion to dismiss (with Declaration of Ken Wang and Declaration of Sandeep Nailwal)
- Jun 27, 2025: Nailwal filed motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction
- Dec 12, 2025: Order on personal jurisdiction issued
- **Plaintiff's Counsel**: Matthew F. Miller, Hanson Bridgett LLP, San Francisco

### Key Detail: Case 3:26-cv-00857 (Goopal v. Jin Wang — $100M RICO)

- **Plaintiffs**: Lujunjin "Vivian" Liu and Goopal Digital Ltd.
- **Defendants named**: Fred Jin, Martijn Broersma, Francois Grenade, Brad Bell, Cerebellum Network (DE), Interdata Network (BVI), CEF AI Inc. (DE)
- **10 causes of action**: RICO, RICO Conspiracy, Fraud, Aiding & Abetting Fraud, Negligent Misrepresentation, Breach of Advisor Agreement, Breach of Token Sale Agreement, Failure to Pay Wages, Civil Theft, Declaratory Relief
- Claims: insiders secretly sold $41M+ in CERE tokens, misappropriated funds
- **Cere legal team assessment**: Kenzi orchestrated this through Vivian as a proxy — he stole her tokens AND told her to sue Cere
- Filed by small LA firm (5 attorneys, 2 partners, 3 associates)
- Question: do plaintiff's attorneys even know Kenzi is behind this? If yes → Rule 11 sanctions possible

### Counter-Strategy (as of Feb 2, 2026)

- Dubai is the real battleground — Feb 26 hearing is critical deadline
- Cerebellum Network Inc. will waive service and file **counterclaim** against Kenzi in Vivian case
- Individual defendants (Mart, Brad, Francois) will NOT waive service
- Dual-track: amend existing CA complaint + file counterclaim before Feb 26 for Dubai admissibility
- Reach out to plaintiff's counsel: "your client is victim of Kenzi's scam"

## F. Recommended Subpoenas

| Exchange | Address | Reason |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **KuCoin** | Deposit `0xB2101F398f0c91f5f802a6a6afc56c58a4567b81` | Received 33.3M stolen CERE — KYC identifies seller |
| **Gate.io** | Withdrawals to `0xb08f79...` | KYC identifies who withdrew AU21 portfolio tokens |
| **OKX** | Deposit `0x2Ca8184d24cb0bff593a88c9b735820f19c873e0` | Received ETH from bridge wallet |
| **ByBit** | Deposit `0xB4263aE344012481912B3f06c692FC70c326B139` | Received ETH from bridge wallet |
| **Binance** | Binance 17 `0x56eddb7aa87536c09ccc2793473599fd21a8b17f` | Funded bridge wallet with ETH |

Note: All four non-US exchanges (KuCoin, OKX, ByBit, Gate.io) are Dubai-registered — Dubai court orders can reach them. US court subpoenas are more difficult for non-US exchanges, but Dubai criminal proceedings provide the path.
