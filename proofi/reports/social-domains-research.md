## Social Media — Detailed Findings

### Twitter/X — @Proofi
- **Status:** ❌ Taken
- **URL:** https://x.com/Proofi
- **Profile:** No bio, no description, no profile picture
- **Stats:** 17 posts, 52 following, 25 followers
- **Activity:** Joined April 2010. Last post: Aug 28, 2016. All other posts from Jan–May 2012. Posts are in Portuguese (Brazilian), mostly Tumblr cross-posts.
- **Assessment:** **Abandoned personal account.** Completely inactive for 10+ years. Zero engagement. This is a Brazilian teenager who auto-posted from Tumblr in 2012 and abandoned the account.
- **Acquisition:** X has a [username squatting policy](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/x-username-squatting). You may be able to claim this handle through X's trademark claim process once Proofi has a registered trademark. Alternatively, try reaching out directly.

### Instagram — @proofi
- **Status:** ❌ Taken
- **URL:** https://instagram.com/proofi
- **Profile:** Display name "IDIOT PROOF"
- **Assessment:** Account exists. Couldn't determine activity level (login wall). The name "IDIOT PROOF" suggests a personal/meme account, possibly low activity.
- **Acquisition:** Instagram allows trademark-based handle claims. Would need a registered trademark.

### LinkedIn — /company/proofi
- **Status:** ❌ Taken
- **URL:** https://linkedin.com/company/proofi
- **Profile:** "Proofi (Professional Office Interiors)" — Москва, РФ (Moscow, Russia)
- **Industry:** Building Materials, 2–10 employees, 17 followers
- **Description:** Exclusive distributor of Dinor (Spain) and AIRCLOS (Spain) in Russia. Office partitions, sliding partitions, glass walls, etc.
- **Assessment:** **Active business entity** (though small). This is a legitimate Russian company using "ПРООФИ" as their brand. Unlikely to release the handle easily.
- **Alternatives:** Consider `/company/proofi-ai`, `/company/getproofi`, or `/company/proofi-verify`

### GitHub — /proofi
- **Status:** ❌ Taken
- **URL:** https://github.com/proofi
- **Profile:** 2 public repos ("gryzgo", "gruzgo.com.ua" — Ukrainian logistics related)
- **Activity:** 0 contributions in the last year. Account created ~2017. Completely dormant.
- **Assessment:** **Inactive squatter/abandoned account.** The repos appear related to a Ukrainian logistics project that was never developed.
- **Acquisition:** GitHub allows [name squatting claims](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-username-policy) for inactive accounts. Strong chance of success given total inactivity.

### TikTok — @proofi
- **Status:** ❌ Taken
- **URL:** https://tiktok.com/@proofi
- **Profile:** Display name "njjc", bio "👻"
- **Stats:** 31 following, 13 followers, 0 likes, **0 published videos**
- **Assessment:** **Empty/abandoned account.** No content whatsoever. Someone registered the username but never used it.
- **Acquisition:** TikTok has [username squatting policies](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines). May be reclaimable with trademark evidence.

### YouTube — @proofi
- **Status:** ❌ Taken
- **URL:** https://youtube.com/@proofi
- **Profile:** Channel name "proofi"
- **Content:** "This channel doesn't have any content"
- **Assessment:** **Empty channel.** Registered but completely unused.
- **Acquisition:** YouTube/Google allows handle reclamation in some cases. Harder than other platforms.

### Discord — discord.gg/proofi
- **Status:** ✅ Available
- **Vanity URL:** The invite code "proofi" returns "Unknown Invite" — not claimed by any server.
- **Username:** Discord usernames (e.g. `proofi`) can't be checked publicly, but the server vanity URL is free.
- **Action:** Claim the vanity URL when creating the Proofi Discord server (requires server boost level 3 / 14 boosts).

## Domains — Detailed Findings

### proofi.ai
- **Status:** ✅ **AVAILABLE — Register immediately**
- **WHOIS:** "Domain not found" — not registered
- **DNS:** No records
- **Registrar:** Available via .ai registrar (e.g., Anguilla registrar, or via Namecheap/Porkbun/GoDaddy)
- **Price:** ~$80–100/year for .ai domains
- **Priority:** 🔴 HIGH — This is the primary domain. Register ASAP before someone notices brand activity.

### proofi.com
- **Status:** ❌ Taken
- **WHOIS:**
  - Registrar: Amazon Registrar, Inc.
  - Created: 2014-03-14
  - Expires: 2026-03-14 (**expires in ~5 weeks!**)
  - Status: clientDeleteProhibited, clientTransferProhibited, clientUpdateProhibited
  - Name servers: AWS DNS (ns-*.awsdns-*.org/co.uk/com/net)
- **DNS:** No A record — domain resolves to nothing (no website)
- **Assessment:** **Parked/held domain.** Registered by someone using Amazon's registrar with AWS infrastructure. No website, no email (no MX records). The triple client-lock suggests the holder is protecting it. Created in 2014, so this is a long-term hold.
- **⚠️ Expiry warning:** Expires March 14, 2026. Worth monitoring — if not renewed, could become available. However, domain squatters typically auto-renew.
- **Acquisition:** Could try making an offer. Expect $5,000–$50,000+ given the .com premium and 10-year hold.

### proofi.io
- **Status:** ✅ **AVAILABLE — Register now**
- **WHOIS:** "Domain not found" — not registered
- **DNS:** No records
- **Price:** ~$30–50/year
- **Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM — Good secondary domain for tech/SaaS branding. Register to protect.

### proofi.xyz
- **Status:** ❌ Taken (for sale)
- **WHOIS:**
  - Registrar: Alibaba Cloud Computing Ltd. (HiChina)
  - Created: 2025-12-06
  - Expires: 2026-12-06
- **Website:** GoDaddy aftermarket landing page — **"proofi.xyz is for sale! $1,999"**
- **Assessment:** **Domain speculator.** Recently registered (Dec 2025) specifically for resale. The $1,999 ask is a starting price — likely negotiable to $500–1,000.
- **Action:** Low priority. Not essential. If you want it, negotiate down.

### getproofi.com
- **Status:** ✅ **AVAILABLE — Register now**
- **WHOIS:** "No match" — not registered
- **Price:** ~$10–15/year
- **Priority:** 🟢 LOW-MEDIUM — Good for marketing/landing pages (e.g., "Get Proofi for your business")

### useproofi.com
- **Status:** ✅ **AVAILABLE — Register now**
- **WHOIS:** "No match" — not registered
- **Price:** ~$10–15/year
- **Priority:** 🟢 LOW — Defensive registration. "Use Proofi" is less compelling than "Get Proofi."

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (this week)
1. **Register proofi.ai** — Primary domain. This is the crown jewel and it's available. Don't wait.
2. **Register proofi.io** — Strong tech/SaaS alternative. Protect the namespace.
3. **Register getproofi.com** — Cheap defensive registration + good for marketing.
4. **Register useproofi.com** — Cheap defensive registration.

### Short-term (this month)
5. **File GitHub username claim** — High success chance given total inactivity. [Submit here](https://support.github.com/contact?tags=dotcom-username-claim).
6. **Monitor proofi.com expiry** — Expires March 14, 2026. Set a reminder. Use a domain monitoring service (e.g., DomainTools).
7. **Claim Discord vanity URL** — When server is created, set the vanity URL to discord.gg/proofi.

### Medium-term (after trademark filing)
8. **File Twitter/X handle claim** — Once you have a trademark, submit a [username squatting report](https://help.x.com/forms/trademark).
9. **File Instagram handle claim** — Same trademark approach.
10. **File TikTok handle claim** — Strong case given 0 content.
11. **Negotiate proofi.com purchase** — Consider reaching out to the holder via Amazon Registrar.

### Alternative Handles
If primary handles can't be acquired, strong alternatives:
- `@proofi_ai` (available on most platforms)
- `@getproofi`
- `@proofiHQ`
- `@useproofi`
