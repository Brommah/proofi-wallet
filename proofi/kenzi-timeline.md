### March 2017 — AU21 Capital Founded
- Co-founds **AU21 Capital** with **Chandler Guo** (early BTC miner, co-founder of Gate.io, early investor in Binance/Huobi/NEO)

- Chandler Guo's Gate.io connection becomes critical later — the exchange used throughout the token theft

### ~2017 — Joins Huobi Global

- MarketScreener lists start date as Dec 31, 2016; most bios say 2017
- **The Org (Kambria)** lists his title as "Director of Growth" — not VP/GM

- Used **multiple aliases** and buzzstarter.com email addresses
- Used a **privacy service** to hide ownership of traction.co
- Offered competing services on the squatted domains
- In 2014, Traction Corporation confronted him; he "provided assurances" but continued infringing
- **Did NOT respond** to the complaint — lost by default judgment

- **Jan 27, 2021**: Additional $320,000 USDC raised in round, also part of "black swan" admission
- Kenzi directs **75+ token purchasers** to send payments to wallets HE personally controlled instead of official Cere company wallets
- Maintains separate **"Token Sale Tracker"** spreadsheet — later revokes company access

### ~2021 — Vijay Garg / Inclusion Capital Investment
- **Vijay Garg** invests ~$130K+ through AU21 involvement
- Kenzi "did nothing" for the fund, changed passwords, tried to redirect tokens to personal wallet
- Garg: "Tell a big story, get you to sign an agreement, then starts exhausting your positive energy and ultimately shakes you down. Keeps doxxing you and saying 'I'm a cofounder, I have these rights, if you don't send me money I will go after you.'"
- Settled for ~$100K; total loss estimated ~$10M (LP money at stake)

### 2021 — Garg v. Wang (SDNY)

- **Dec 23, 2021**: Kenzi states "I'll handle Vivian" / "I'll take Vivian and Jacky" in Slack communications
- Ensures no one at Cere can independently verify Vivian's wallet address
- A wallet address appears in the distribution master sheet that **Vivian Liu never provided**:
  - Substrate: `5DZMJ4GD8MDhp2Pxsri3ysqRqoE3KfsSGE7zMgGDVngbUrwv`
  - Cere mainnet: `6R1GPxm3jqiRgjFXkFGLWh2XbcwZysRgXWmZjsyq43pSrwFu`
- Google Sheets cell history shows: "**deleted user**" entered the wallet address — not any current team member

### 2021 — AU21 Portfolio Investments (Relevant to Later Fingerprinting)
- **April 2021**: AU21 Capital invests in **Raze Network** (RAZE) as funding partner
- **May 2021**: AU21 Capital participates in **Skyrim Finance** (SKYRIM) $2.1M round
- These tokens later appear in the same bridge wallet as stolen CERE — creating the unique AU21 portfolio fingerprint

### January 2022 — ZachXBT Calls Out Kenzi

- Tweet: https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1483577541587783690

- Screenshot evidence (Dec 2021/Jan 2022): Dylan Dewdney, **Kevin Hsu**, and **Denko Mancheski** confirm Paralink was controlled by Kenzi
- **Kevin Hsu** originally introduced Dylan to Kenzi — then Kevin also got scammed by Kenzi's projects
- Dylan Dewdney: "happy to sign anything" — affidavit drafted for legal proceedings
- This invest-then-compete pattern is used as evidence for SEC unregistered broker-dealer filing

- Raises $50M fund
- Coverage: TechCrunch, CoinDesk, Decrypt, The Block, Forbes India

- This fundraise occurs **in the same period** evidence was being gathered about his $4.4M+ diversion from Cere

### 2022 — Additional Dead Advisory Projects
- **Wanaka Farm (WANA)**: Kenzi serves as "Strategic Advisor" — token drops to $0.001715, effectively dead
- **Dragon Kart (KART)**: AU21 Capital invests, Kenzi advises — token drops to $0.00455 (99.1% loss), $0 daily volume

- Practus LLP investigation found the **opposite**: Wang was the one diverting funds
- Source: MEXC News

### January 27, 2026 — $100M RICO Lawsuit Filed
- **Goopal Digital Ltd. v. Jin Wang et al.** — Case **3:26-cv-00857** (N.D. Cal.)
- Plaintiffs: **Lujunjin "Vivian" Liu** and **Goopal Digital Ltd.**
- Defendants: Fred Jin, Martin (Mart), Francois Grenade, Cerebellum Network (DE), Interdata Network (BVI), CEF AI Inc. (DE)
- Claims: RICO + 9 counts, $25M compensatory + $75M punitive = $100M total
- Allegations: insiders secretly sold $41M+ in CERE tokens, misappropriated funds, overstated enterprise adoption
- **Key context**: Cere's legal team believes **Kenzi orchestrated this lawsuit through Vivian as a proxy**
  - Kenzi stole Vivian's tokens AND told her to sue Cere
  - Plaintiff's law firm: small LA firm, 5 attorneys, 2 partners, 3 associates — viewed as "hired guns"
  - Question: do plaintiff's attorneys even know Kenzi is behind this?
  - If yes → Rule 11 sanctions possible

### January 29, 2026 — CoinDesk Article Published
- "Investors accuse Cere Network of $100M fraud and token dump scheme in lawsuit"
- **One-sided** — no comment from Cere; calls Fred Jin "ringleader"
- URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/01/29/investors-accuse-cere-network-of-usd100m-fraud-and-token-dump-scheme-in-lawsuit
- Cere team drafts urgent correction DM and lawyer email
- Additional coverage: MEXC News, TechFlow, Law360, Russian-language Bits Media

### January 29, 2026 — Full On-Chain Evidence Traced
- Mart provides Ethereum bridge wallet `0xb08f79488D335FBc7E0881c78ba341dA1f249f00`
- Full flow verified: Cere mainnet → fake wallet → intermediary → bridge to Polygon → bridge to Ethereum → sold on KuCoin
- Gate.io connection confirmed: AU21 portfolio tokens (RAZE, SKYRIM) from Gate.io in same wallet
- **Krishna** shared Statescan link for intermediary wallet
- Multiple documents created for legal team (evidence memo, bridge synopsis, hyperlinked Google Doc)

### January 30, 2026 — Legal Strategy Call
- Participants: **Fred Jin, Rocky Lee** (Milliard Law), **Matt Miller** (Hanson Bridgett), **Jenny** (counsel)
- **Rocky Lee**: former connections to #2 at DOJ; going to UAE to meet high-level government contact
- Strategy: dual-track (amend existing CA complaint + file counterclaim in Vivian case)
- **Feb 26 Dubai hearing is critical deadline** — criminal conviction would force global settlement
- Non-US exchange subpoenas difficult from US court → but Dubai action can be used (all registered there)
- Plan: reach out to plaintiff's counsel — "your client is victim of Kenzi's scam"

### February 1, 2026 — Deep Research Marathon
- 4 research files produced (20 + 23 + 10+ findings across 3 rounds + final consolidated report)
- **Key new discoveries**:
  - Interdata v. Wang, Nailwal, Hu (3:25-cv-03798) — Sandeep Nailwal is co-defendant
  - Shared defense attorney (Sergenian Law)
  - Wikitia page was paid creation (Ankush.srg)
  - 5 fabricated references
  - NEA/Lightbank funding completely fabricated
  - Traction Labs "acquisition" fabricated
  - 4 different Columbia majors across platforms
  - hadron.cloud CEO was Cliff Szu, not Kenzi
  - $ELE pump-and-dump with named participants
  - Sachi Kamiya conflict web
  - Kenzi Wang Scholarship targeting minors (15–19)
  - Second LinkedIn account (kwang2)

### February 2, 2026 — Litigation Strategy Call
- Participants: **Fred Jin, Jenny, Matt Miller, Rocky Lee**
- **Critical decisions**:
  1. Dubai is the real battleground — Feb 26 criminal hearing
  2. Cerebellum Network Inc will waive service and file **counterclaim** in Vivian case
  3. Individual defendants (Brad, Francois, Martin) will NOT waive service
  4. Dual-track: amend existing complaint + file counterclaim before Feb 26
  5. Counter-narrative: Kenzi stole Vivian's tokens, she's suing the wrong party
- **Vivian token theft key facts for filing**:
  - Mart contacted Vivian 11/14/2023 about token distribution
  - Kevin (co-plaintiff, part of Kenzi syndicate) responded briefly, then ghosted
  - Google Sheets cell history: "deleted user" entered wallet address
  - Kenzi said "I'll handle Vivian" on 12/23/2021
  - 5,000+ Republic investors + 160+ private investors all received tokens — Vivian is the ONLY exception
- **Vivian's advisory claim**: Says "several hundred hours" of work — company was never informed, never invoiced
- **Vivian adviser agreement found**: signed as "Lujunjin Liu" — only 1–2 calls, no services rendered

### February 2, 2026 — Dylan Dewdney Affidavit Completed
- **Google Doc**: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gFICIJLoV4wdiF2W2Uu0Xt9e0srpI2sb/edit
- Documents: Dylan as Kylin co-founder, Kenzi's invest-then-compete with Paralink
- Screenshot evidence: Dylan, Kevin Hsu, Denko Mancheski confirm Paralink controlled by Kenzi
- **New intel**: Dylan knows Chad Liu well; knows co-founder of project acquired by Sandeep (Sequence)
- Dylan asking about Sandeep's support of Kenzi → informed Sandeep is co-defendant
- Strengthens SEC broker-dealer filing: invest-then-compete pattern across multiple projects

### February 2, 2026 — Chain Analysis Outreach
- 9 forensic firms identified in 3 tiers, 5 draft emails ready
- Priority: **Chainalysis** (Fred knows CEO Scott Frederick from Binance Labs cohort) > TRM Labs > Elliptic
- Budget: $15–50K, timeline 2–4 weeks
- Their reports are used by DOJ/FBI as real evidence

## E. MODUS OPERANDI (Pattern Across All Ventures)

1. **Present as connected insider** — fabricated credentials, inflated titles, paid PR
2. **Gain trust and access** — join as advisor/co-founder, get control of wallets/accounts
3. **Divert value** — redirect investor funds, insert fake wallet addresses, cut side deals
4. **Evidence destruction** — revoke access, delete files, change passwords
5. **Intimidation when caught** — threatening letters from Singapore law firms, doxxing, "I'm a cofounder, I have rights"
6. **DARVO** — file countersuits accusing victims of exactly what he did
7. **Move on** — rebrand funds, create new entities, start fresh with fabricated history
8. **Repeat** — 7+ fund entities in 8 years, each recycling the same playbook
