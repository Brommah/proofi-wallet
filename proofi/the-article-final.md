# I Spent 6 Years Tracing a Fraudster's Wallets. Here's Why LinkedIn Should Terrify You.

**33 million tokens. Stolen by a man with a perfect LinkedIn profile. And nobody checked a single credential.**

*By Martijn Broersma*

---

In March 2022, 13,333,334 CERE tokens were sent from our company wallet to an investor named Vivian Liu.

At least, that's what the spreadsheet said.

Vivian never got those tokens. Someone had swapped her wallet address in the distribution sheet with one she'd never seen. The tokens landed, sat for eight hours, then drained through an intermediary wallet and vanished.

Two months later — 20 million more tokens. Same fake wallet. Same drain pattern. Gone within hours.

**Total stolen: 33,333,334 CERE tokens.** From a single investor. By someone inside our operation.

I know who did it. I've spent six years proving it.

And the story of how one man ran an intercontinental fraud operation — across four countries, through fake VC funds, fabricated credentials, and stolen wallets — while maintaining a *spotless LinkedIn profile the entire time* — is the story of why professional trust on the internet is fundamentally broken.

But it's also the story of how we fix it.

## Meet Kenzi Wang. You've Probably Seen His LinkedIn.

His profile reads like a Silicon Valley fairy tale.

Y Combinator. Huobi Vice President. Columbia graduate. GP at a16z crypto. Investments in Tesla, SpaceX, Perplexity. Co-founder of a $50 million fund with Polygon's Sandeep Nailwal.

**Every single claim is either fabricated or inflated.** And I have the receipts.

**The "CEO" title?** He co-founded Buzzstarter (later Traction Labs). Forbes described him as a "growth engineer" — not CEO, not co-founder. His actual co-founder Tiffany Pham wrote that piece. Within years, Kenzi had promoted himself to "CEO and Co-founder" across every platform.

**The seed funding?** He claims NEA and Lightbank. The real investors, per TechCrunch and AdExchanger: China Rock Capital, Telegraph Hill Capital, 500 Startups, Digital Garage. NEA and Lightbank appear nowhere. Fabricated.

**The "acquisition"?** The TechCrunch URL he cites — `techcrunch.com/2017/03/10/traction-labs-acquired/` — returns a **404 Not Found**. The article doesn't exist. Because the acquisition never happened. A Reddit user noted the marketplace "disappeared by the end of 2015." MarketScreener lists December 31, 2016 as the end date. No acquirer has ever been named.

**The Huobi "VP" title?** The Org, a verified organizational data platform, lists him as "Director of Growth." Per someone who worked with him closely: Kenzi was "fired from Huobi for many bad reasons."

**Columbia University?** He's claimed four different majors across different platforms: Computer Science, Mathematics, Mathematical Sciences, and Math+Finance. His former co-founder Emmie Chang told investigators he "likely lied about graduating from Columbia and Wharton."

**GP at a16z crypto?** Appears on CypherHunter and nowhere else. Not on a16z's public team page. Never was.

**Invested in Tesla, SpaceX, Perplexity?** These claims exist only on a paid Wikitia page created by a professional page creation service. That page contains five fabricated reference URLs, all returning 404 errors.

Every credential on this man's profile is a lie. And LinkedIn presented each one as fact for over six years.

## The Playbook: How to Steal Millions While Looking Legitimate

Kenzi didn't just lie on his resume. He weaponized those lies to steal. Here's the playbook:

### Step 1: Present as a connected insider.

Fabricated credentials. Inflated titles. Paid Wikipedia knock-offs. Looks real if you don't check.

### Step 2: Gain trust and access.

Join as advisor or co-founder. Get wallet access. Get admin credentials. Get between investors and the company.

### Step 3: Divert value.

In January 2021, Kenzi directed 75+ token purchasers to send payments to wallets *he personally controlled* instead of official company wallets.

He maintained a separate "Token Sale Tracker" spreadsheet — then revoked the company's access to it.

- January 19, 2021: **$2,671,400 USDC** in his personal Binance custody
- January 27: another **$320,000**
- April 2023: **$1,382,000** in unapproved wallets
- May 2023: another **$444,500** identified as a "shadow admin gap"

**Total direct theft confirmed: $4,817,900.**

But the token theft was his masterpiece.

In December 2021, Kenzi insisted on handling investor Vivian Liu's distribution personally. *"I'll handle Vivian,"* he wrote in Slack. He then inserted a wallet address that Vivian had never provided.

Google Sheets cell history shows the address was entered by a "deleted user" — not any current team member. The digital equivalent of planting evidence before you torch the building.

The tokens went to that fake wallet. **33.3 million CERE.** Vivian's entire allocation. Stolen.

### Step 4: Liquidate.

On January 6, 2024, the stolen tokens started moving. First a test: 33,333 CERE bridged from Cere mainnet → Polygon → Ethereum. Same day: sent to KuCoin. Next day: the remaining 33.3 million followed the same path.

Test first. Then full amount. Deliberate. Cautious. Sophisticated.

But here's what made the wallet traceable: on January 31, 2024, that same bridge wallet received tokens from Gate.io — the exchange co-founded by Chandler Guo, who also co-founded AU21 Capital with Kenzi.

What tokens? **5.37 million SKYRIM and 30.6 million RAZE.** Both niche DeFi tokens. Both AU21 Capital portfolio companies. The chances of those three tokens appearing in the same wallet belonging to anyone *other* than Kenzi Wang are essentially zero.

By July 2024, the wallet was drained through KuCoin, Gate.io, OKX, and ByBit. Final balance: $0.04.

**Blockchain doesn't lie. People do. But the blockchain remembers everything they did.**

### Step 5: DARVO.

Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender.

In January 2026, Kenzi filed a $58 million countersuit — accusing our CEO of exactly what Kenzi himself did. An independent Practus LLP investigation had already concluded: *"No evidence to support Wang's allegations."*

Then the coup de grâce: a **$100 million RICO lawsuit** filed by Vivian Liu — the same Vivian whose tokens Kenzi stole. Our legal team believes Kenzi orchestrated this through Vivian as a proxy.

He stole her tokens, then convinced her to sue *us* for not giving them to her.

Let that level of sociopathy sink in.

### Step 6: Move on.

In August 2022 — *while actively stealing from Cere* — Kenzi raised a $50 million fund with Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal. Covered breathlessly by TechCrunch, CoinDesk, Decrypt, The Block, and Forbes India.

Not one outlet mentioned his **felony grand theft charge from 2018** (Case No. 18017577, San Francisco). Not one mentioned the SuperBloom scam (BitcoinTalk scam warning). Not one mentioned the seven domains stripped from him by arbitration.

In July 2024, his new venture Sentient raised **$85 million** from Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and Pantera Capital. His wife is "Director of Business Operations." His fund is simultaneously an investor. If you can't see the conflict of interest, it's because you're not supposed to.

ZachXBT, crypto's most respected fraud investigator, called out Kenzi as early as January 2022. His former co-founder Emmie Chang called him **"the white-collar crypto version of the Tinder Swindler."**

Total documented damage from Cere alone: **$104,967,900+**.

And through all of this — every stolen token, every fabricated credential, every pump-and-dump, every felony charge — **his LinkedIn profile remained pristine.**

## LinkedIn Didn't Just Miss It. LinkedIn *Can't* Catch It.

Here's the uncomfortable truth LinkedIn doesn't want you to think about:

**The platform has no verification layer.** None. Zero. You type your credentials, and they become "real." That's the entire system.

Try boarding a plane with a self-reported passport. You'd be arrested.

But we trust our entire professional identity — the thing that determines whether you get hired, funded, or trusted with millions — to a system with **less verification than a nightclub bouncer.**

The numbers:

- In 2023, LinkedIn blocked **121 million fake accounts.** They claim 99.65% catch rate — meaning **~424,000 fake accounts still get through every year.**
- In June 2021, data from **700 million LinkedIn users** (92% of all accounts) was scraped and sold on the dark web. LinkedIn's response? *"Scraping, not a breach."* A distinction that means nothing when your data is on a hacker forum for the price of a coffee.
- The endorsement system? Per interviewing.io: *"The point of endorsements isn't to get at the truth. It's to keep recruiters feeling like they're getting value."* A marketing intern can endorse a brain surgeon for "Neurosurgery." No check. No validation. No consequence.

**LinkedIn is a $17 billion company built on self-reported data, meaningless endorsements, and selling YOUR professional identity to recruiters at $10,000 per seat per year.**

You are the product. Recruiters are the customer. And nobody — absolutely nobody — is verifying whether anything on the platform is true.

---

## Now Let's Talk About Who Built This System

LinkedIn was co-founded by Reid Hoffman — Silicon Valley's most connected "philosopher-king." The man whose platform controls the professional identity of a billion people.

That same Reid Hoffman visited Jeffrey Epstein's private island.

This isn't conspiracy. In December 2025, Hoffman confirmed on the Eric Newcomer podcast that he spent a night on Epstein's island, claiming it was for MIT Foundation fundraising. He *"was told Epstein would be more likely to donate to MIT if he visited."*

In September 2019, Hoffman apologized for facilitating Epstein-linked donations to MIT Media Lab — inviting Epstein to events at the request of director Joi Ito.

I'm not making a guilt-by-association argument. **I'm making a priorities argument.**

The man who designed the platform that controls your professional reputation thought visiting a pedophile's island was worth it to secure a donation. That tells you everything about where "trust" and "verification" ranked in LinkedIn's design philosophy.

Then there's the current owner. Microsoft acquired LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in 2016. Microsoft — the company guided by Bill Gates as "technology advisor" until he quietly stepped down from the board in 2020.

The same Bill Gates who met with Epstein **dozens of times** after Epstein's 2008 conviction. Who flew on Epstein's private jet. Who, per The New York Times, had Epstein pitch a proposed charitable fund to JPMorgan in which Gates and Epstein would share in the profits.

So: LinkedIn was **co-founded** by a man who visited Epstein's island. **Owned** by a company whose technology advisor repeatedly met with a convicted sex offender.

This is the institution that controls your professional identity. These are the people who decided self-reported credentials were good enough.

**Your professional reputation lives on a platform built by people who valued fundraising access over basic moral due diligence.**

LinkedIn was never designed to verify truth. It was designed to sell access. To monetize your professional graph. To extract maximum revenue from recruiters searching through unverified data.

And we just... accepted this. For twenty years. Because there was no alternative.

## The Credential Graveyard: Why Every Fix Failed

It's not like nobody tried. The blockchain credential space is littered with corpses.

**Blockcerts** (MIT, 2016): Anchored credential hashes to Bitcoin. But a hash isn't a solution — it's a receipt. No storage, no queries, no economics. Learning Machine got buried in Hyland's enterprise portfolio.

**Sovrin Network** (2016): Built an entire blockchain for self-sovereign identity. Got 75+ organizations as nodes. Then laid off all staff in June 2020 because they couldn't answer *"who pays for this?"* The network technically runs. Like a brain-dead patient on life support.

**uPort → Veramo → Serto** (ConsenSys): Pivoted so many times they fragmented into three products, none of which survived. Turns out $50 gas fees per identity operation kill adoption.

**Microsoft ION** (2021): Built Identity Overlay Network on Bitcoin. Quietly removed it. Pivoted to `did:web` — literally a centralized domain identifier. Even Microsoft, with unlimited resources, couldn't make single-layer decentralized identity work.

**The pattern:** Every project tried to solve a full-stack problem with a single-layer fix.

You can't kill an ecosystem with a feature. LinkedIn "works" — in its broken, unverified way — because it's a full stack: profiles, search, messaging, jobs, endorsements, feed.

**To replace it, you don't need better credentials. You need a better *system*.**

## What I Built While Fighting a Fraudster

I joined Cere Network in 2020. I didn't plan to spend six years tracing stolen wallets across four blockchains and four countries.

But fraud has a way of rearranging your priorities.

Somewhere between the exchange subpoenas and the Dubai criminal filings, I had a realization:

**The same technology that let me trace Kenzi's wallets is the technology that would have prevented his fraud from ever starting.**

If his credentials had been verifiable on-chain, his entire operation collapses on day one:

- *"GP of AU21 Capital"?* → Where's the on-chain verification?
- *"VP at Huobi"?* → Show me the signed employment credential.
- *"Columbia graduate"?* → Where's the cryptographically signed degree?
- *"Investor in 50+ projects"?* → Show me verified transaction records.

Every lie he told could have been caught instantly — if credentials weren't just words on a screen.

Most credential platforms are built by people who read about fraud in case studies. **Proofi is built by someone who fought it for six years.** Every design decision comes from real adversarial experience. I know which attack vectors exist because I've personally defended against them — in courts, on blockchains, across jurisdictions.

## Proofi.ai: The Full Stack That Actually Works

Proofi is built on the Cere + CEF architecture. Not a whitepaper. Running code.

### The Trust Anchor

Every credential gets anchored on the Cere blockchain. 50-70 validators. Smart contracts handle credential records, revocation, and governance. No single entity — no company, no founder, no Kenzi Wang — can change the rules.

Think of it as a notary. Except the notary is math, not a human you have to trust.

### Where Your Credentials Live

This is the layer that killed every previous credential project: **storage.**

Cere's Decentralized Data Clusters (DDC): 63 nodes, 99.9% uptime, 114ms response. Your credential gets a Content ID — change one bit and you get a different ID. Mathematical integrity, not a pinky promise.

**Field-level encryption** makes selective disclosure possible: share your degree without sharing your GPA. Share your title without your salary. You control what anyone sees.

Cost? **$0.01 per GB per month.** One-seventh of AWS S3. Credential storage that's economically viable at planet scale.

### Making Credentials Searchable

Storing credentials is useless if you can't find them.

The Data Stream Compute layer transforms credential events into queryable knowledge. Want *"all verified software engineers with AWS certifications in Berlin, verified in the last six months"*? Sub-second results across millions of credentials.

No other credential project has anything remotely like this. It's the difference between a filing cabinet and Google.

### The Agents That Replace LinkedIn

This is where it gets interesting.

**Your Personal Agent** — your AI credential manager. It submits documents for verification, controls what's shared with whom, and notifies you when someone checks your credentials. Future: zero-knowledge proofs that let you prove you have a degree without revealing which university. *Your credentials. Your rules. No platform extracting rent.*

**Organization Agents** — run by universities, employers, certification bodies. You claim "I graduated from TU Delft in 2018" → TU Delft's agent reviews it, matches records, issues a cryptographically signed credential on-chain. Every verification earns them CERE tokens. Truth becomes profitable.

**Recruiter Agents** — no more paying LinkedIn $10,000/seat to search unverified data. Search verified credentials across the entire network. Every result is cryptographically proven. *"ML engineers, 3+ years FAANG, EU timezone"* → results you can actually trust.

**LinkedIn charges you to access unverified data. Proofi lets you access verified data. That's not an improvement. That's a category shift.**

### The Economics That Keep It Alive

Remember Sovrin? Died because nobody could answer "who pays?"

Proofi's economic loop:

- **Organizations** issue credentials → earn CERE tokens
- **Recruiters** search and verify → pay CERE tokens
- **Individuals** control their data → free (subsidized by recruiter demand)
- **Node operators** store credentials → earn CERE tokens

No ads. No premium subs. No selling your data. **The protocol is the business model.**

If you cheat, you get slashed. Not "we'll look into it" — economic penalties enforced by code.

**LinkedIn makes money by keeping your data hostage. Proofi makes money by keeping your data honest.**

## The World Where Kenzi Can't Operate

Picture this.

Kenzi Wang walks into a meeting claiming to be GP of a major fund. The investor's agent checks for a verified credential from AU21 Capital. **Nothing.** Red flag.

Claims a Columbia degree. Agent checks for a university-issued credential. Four different majors, zero verifications. **Red flag.**

Claims VP at Huobi. No signed employment credential. **Red flag.**

Claims Traction Labs was acquired. No M&A confirmation from any acquirer. **Red flag.**

Before the meeting ends, the investor knows. Not because they spent three days doing due diligence. Not because they hired a PI. Not because they found the right Reddit thread.

**Because the cryptographic absence of verified credentials is, itself, a signal.**

In a world of verified credentials, silence speaks louder than lies.

---

## What Happens Next

Kenzi Wang was arrested in Dubai on our criminal complaint. Passport surrendered. Travel ban active. Two criminal cases in Dubai Criminal Court — not Misdemeanor Court. **Criminal Court.** Minimum five-year jail exposure if convicted.

Additional criminal cases ready to file. SEC unregistered broker-dealer filing in preparation. Chain analysis firms engaged for the forensic reports that DOJ and FBI accept as evidence.

But here's the thing: **even when Kenzi is convicted, the system that enabled him still exists.**

LinkedIn will still let anyone claim anything. Background checks will still take weeks and cost hundreds. Professional trust will still be a game of "who has the most convincing profile."

Unless we change the infrastructure.

## This Is My Last LinkedIn Post

I'm posting this on the very platform it indicts. Ironic? Yes. Strategic? Also yes.

Because the 1 billion people on LinkedIn need to hear this. Not in a crypto echo chamber. Not on a niche Substack. **Here. Where the problem lives.**

I'm not telling you to delete LinkedIn today.

I'm telling you the era of self-reported credentials is ending.

There's now a system where your degree isn't a text field — it's a **cryptographic proof**. Where your work history isn't what you typed — it's what your employer **signed**. Where a recruiter doesn't trust your profile — they **verify it in milliseconds**.

**[Proofi.ai](https://proofi.ai) is live.** Subscribe for early access.

When it launches, you'll be able to:

✅ Submit credentials for verification by the institutions that issued them
✅ Control exactly who sees what, with field-level encryption
✅ Let your Personal Agent manage verification requests automatically
✅ Build a professional identity that's actually *yours* — not LinkedIn's to monetize

I spent six years learning how trust breaks.

Every wallet trace, every fabricated credential, every courtroom filing taught me what happens when platforms gatekeep professional identity without accountability.

Proofi is what I built with those lessons.

The fraudsters had their run. The platforms that protected them had their run.

**It's time for credentials that can't be faked, on a platform that can't be gamed, owned by the people they belong to.**

👉 **Subscribe at [proofi.ai](https://proofi.ai). The receipts are coming.**

*If you've been defrauded by Kenzi Wang, AU21 Capital, or Symbolic Capital — or have information relevant to ongoing legal proceedings — reach out. We're building the case. And unlike LinkedIn, we verify.*

*If you're an institution interested in becoming an early issuing organization on Proofi, or a developer who wants to build on the Cere + CEF stack: the SDKs are ready. The infrastructure is live. Let's build the trust layer the internet should have had from the start.*

## Optimal Posting Time

- **Tuesday or Wednesday, 8:00-9:30 AM CET** (7:00-8:30 AM GMT / 2:00-3:30 AM EST)
  - Catches European morning commute + US late-night scrollers
  - Tuesday/Wednesday consistently outperform other days for long-form content
- **Backup: Thursday 8:00 AM CET** if you want to ride into the weekend news cycle

## Hashtags (max 3-5 for LinkedIn algorithm)

```
#LinkedInFraud #VerifiedCredentials #Web3 #CryptoFraud #Proofi
```

Alt combo (broader reach):
```
#ProfessionalIdentity #BlockchainVerification #TrustInTech #FraudPrevention
```

## Who to Tag

### Direct tags in the post:
- **Reid Hoffman** — co-founder of LinkedIn (will drive engagement whether he responds or not)
- **ZachXBT** — crypto fraud investigator who already called out Kenzi
- **Sandeep Nailwal** — Polygon co-founder, co-defendant (nuclear option — high engagement, high risk)

### Tag in comments (first comment, immediately after posting):
- **Emmie Chang** — Kenzi's former co-founder who called him "Tinder Swindler of crypto"
- **Dylan Dewdney** — Kylin Network founder, victim of invest-then-compete scheme
- **CoinDesk**, **The Block**, **Decrypt** — crypto media outlets
- **TechCrunch** — for the broader fraud/identity angle
- **Peter Thiel / Founders Fund** — invested $85M in Kenzi's latest venture

## Engagement Strategy

1. **First comment** (post immediately): Add the tags above + "Full blockchain evidence, court documents, and wallet traces in the article. Every claim is sourced."
2. **Hour 1-2**: Respond to every comment. LinkedIn's algorithm rewards early engagement heavily.
3. **Hour 3-6**: Share to relevant LinkedIn groups (Blockchain, Crypto, Startup, VC groups).
4. **Day 2**: Cross-post teaser to Twitter/X with link to LinkedIn article. Tag @zachxbt.
5. **Day 3-5**: Reshare with different angles:
   - "The Reid Hoffman / Epstein angle"
   - "How $104M was stolen with a fake LinkedIn profile"
   - "Why I'm building the anti-LinkedIn"

## Content Amplification

- Ask 10-15 trusted connections to like + comment within the first hour (LinkedIn's algorithm is heavily time-weighted)
- Prepare 3-4 "response comments" for predictable objections:
  - *"Isn't this just a crypto problem?"* → No, $121M fake LinkedIn accounts affects everyone
  - *"LinkedIn has verification badges now"* → Only for workplace, still self-reported job titles
  - *"Blockchain credentials sound complicated"* → Proofi handles it. You just submit docs.
