# Cere Network — Statement Regarding Recent Media Coverage

**Date:** February 2026  
**From:** Cere Network  
**Re:** Response to CoinDesk article "Investors accuse Cere Network of $100M fraud" (January 29, 2026)

---

## SHORT VERSION — For Quick Emails & DMs

We are aware of the recent CoinDesk article alleging fraud against Cere Network. The article is based on a one-sided complaint filed by a single individual — orchestrated by Kenzi Wang, a former advisor who is currently under criminal prosecution in Dubai, with his passport confiscated and a travel ban in place. Kenzi Wang is the subject of two active criminal cases and a civil lawsuit filed by Cere for $1.3 million in stolen funds. On-chain evidence and blockchain forensic analysis demonstrate that Mr. Wang — not Cere — is responsible for the misappropriation of tokens at the center of these allegations.

Every one of Cere's 5,000+ Republic investors and 160+ private investors received their tokens as promised. The complainant is the sole exception — and the evidence shows her tokens were redirected by Mr. Wang while he served as her exclusive intermediary. Cere is vigorously defending against these baseless claims, has filed counterclaims, and is cooperating with authorities across multiple jurisdictions. We have engaged professional blockchain analysis firms to produce court-admissible evidence documenting the full chain of custody. A Dubai court ruling on Mr. Wang's criminal cases is expected on February 26, 2026. We remain focused on building and shipping, and we will continue to update our investors as the legal process unfolds.

## FULL VERSION — Comprehensive Response

### Background

On January 29, 2026, CoinDesk published an article titled "Investors accuse Cere Network of $100M fraud." The article was based almost entirely on a civil complaint filed in Los Angeles by a small plaintiff's firm on behalf of a single individual: Vivian Liu. The article did not include any comment from Cere Network, nor did it reference the extensive counter-evidence that contradicts the complaint's narrative.

We understand that this coverage may cause concern among our investors and community. This statement provides the facts.

### What Actually Happened

Between 2021 and 2022, **Kenzi Wang** — a former advisor to Cere Network and co-founder of AU21 Capital — positioned himself as the sole intermediary between Cere and Ms. Liu. On December 23, 2021, Mr. Wang explicitly told the team: *"I'll handle Vivian."* From that point forward, all communication with Ms. Liu was routed exclusively through him.

During the token distribution process, a wallet address was entered into Cere's distribution records — not by any current team member, but by a user whose account was subsequently deleted. The tokens allocated to Ms. Liu — 33,333,334 CERE — were sent to this address in good faith.

What happened next tells the story: **within eight hours of receipt**, the entire balance was transferred out of that wallet through intermediary addresses. The tokens sat dormant for nearly two years before being moved through multiple blockchain bridges and sold across four international exchanges in a pattern consistent with money laundering.

Meanwhile, more than **5,000 Republic investors** and **160+ private investors** all received their tokens without incident. Ms. Liu is the only investor whose tokens went missing — and Mr. Wang was the only variable unique to her situation.

### Who Is Kenzi Wang?

Mr. Wang is not a passive bystander in this story. He is a former advisor with a documented history of misconduct:

- **Currently under criminal prosecution in Dubai** — arrested, passport confiscated, active travel ban. Two criminal cases (Nos. 31801/2025 and 33359/2025) are before the Dubai Criminal Court, with a ruling expected **February 26, 2026**. He faces up to five years imprisonment.

- **Subject of a civil lawsuit filed by Cere** in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California for **$1.3 million** in stolen influencer sale proceeds — funds Mr. Wang collected on Cere's behalf and never remitted.

- **Named in a separate federal lawsuit** (Case 3:25-cv-03798, N.D. Cal.) involving additional allegations of misconduct.

- **Documented pattern of behavior** across multiple crypto projects, including invest-and-compete schemes, token dumping, and misrepresentation of credentials. Multiple individuals from other projects have provided or are prepared to provide sworn testimony regarding his conduct.

### The Complaint Is Orchestrated by Mr. Wang

We have strong reason to believe — supported by evidence — that the complaint filed in Ms. Liu's name was orchestrated by Kenzi Wang himself. The same individual who stole her tokens is now using her name to attack the company he defrauded. This is consistent with a pattern of behavior where Mr. Wang creates confusion and misdirection to avoid accountability.

We note that Ms. Liu may herself be a victim of Mr. Wang's manipulation. The evidence regarding her awareness and involvement is still being evaluated, and we will address this appropriately through the legal process.

### The On-Chain Evidence

Blockchain transactions are permanent and public. The movement of Ms. Liu's tokens — from the unauthorized wallet, through intermediary addresses, across bridges to other networks, and into exchanges — is fully documented on-chain.

Cere has engaged **professional blockchain forensic firms** — including leaders in the field whose work is accepted as evidence by the U.S. Department of Justice, the FBI, and courts worldwide — to produce a comprehensive, court-admissible report tracing the full path of these tokens from distribution to liquidation.

Additionally, through ongoing legal proceedings in Dubai, Cere is pursuing **exchange disclosure orders** that will identify the account holders who ultimately sold the stolen tokens.

### What Cere Is Doing

1. **Defending vigorously** against the baseless complaint and filing counterclaims establishing that Mr. Wang — not Cere — stole Ms. Liu's tokens.

2. **Pursuing criminal prosecution** in Dubai, where Mr. Wang is already under arrest conditions, with a court ruling imminent.

3. **Expanding our civil case** in U.S. federal court to include the token theft alongside the already-filed $1.3M claim.

4. **Engaging top-tier blockchain analysis firms** to produce forensic evidence documenting the complete chain of custody.

5. **Cooperating with authorities** across jurisdictions to ensure accountability.

6. **Continuing to build.** Our team is focused on product development, partnerships, and delivering value to our community. We will not be distracted by orchestrated attacks.

### Token Distribution Track Record

This bears repeating: **every single investor** — across more than 5,000 Republic participants and 160+ private investors — received their tokens as specified. The distribution process was executed systematically and verifiably. The sole anomaly involves Ms. Liu, whose tokens were intercepted by the one person who made himself the exclusive conduit to her: Kenzi Wang.

### What to Expect Next

- **February 26, 2026**: Dubai Criminal Court ruling on Mr. Wang's cases.
- **Counterclaim filing** in U.S. federal court (in progress).
- **Blockchain forensic report** completion (in progress).
- We will provide updates to our investor community as material developments occur.

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### Q: Is the $100M fraud allegation true?

**No.** The complaint was filed by a single individual, orchestrated by the same person our evidence shows stole her tokens. Cere distributed tokens to all 5,000+ Republic investors and 160+ private investors without issue. The allegations are contradicted by on-chain evidence, communication records, and the fact that the orchestrator — Kenzi Wang — is currently under criminal prosecution in Dubai.

### Q: Did Cere investors receive their tokens?

**Yes.** Every investor — Republic and private — received their allocated tokens. Ms. Liu is the sole exception, and the evidence points squarely at Mr. Wang as the cause.

### Q: Who is Kenzi Wang?

A former advisor to Cere Network and co-founder of AU21 Capital. He is currently under criminal prosecution in Dubai (passport confiscated, travel ban active), subject to a $1.3M civil lawsuit filed by Cere for stolen funds, and connected to misconduct allegations across multiple other crypto projects.

### Q: Why didn't Cere comment in the CoinDesk article?

The article was published without adequate opportunity for Cere to respond. We are now providing a comprehensive response backed by evidence. We are also engaging with media to ensure accurate reporting going forward.

### Q: Is Kenzi Wang really under arrest in Dubai?

Yes. Mr. Wang was arrested and interrogated in Dubai. His passport has been confiscated and a travel ban is in effect. Two criminal cases are before the Dubai Criminal Court, with a ruling scheduled for February 26, 2026. He faces up to five years of imprisonment if convicted.

### Q: What is the $1.3M civil case about?

Separately from the token theft, Cere filed suit against Mr. Wang in U.S. federal court for $1.3 million in cryptocurrency proceeds from influencer token sales that he conducted on Cere's behalf and never remitted. This was discovered and filed before the full scope of the token theft came to light — demonstrating a pattern of misappropriation.

### Q: How do you know the tokens were stolen by Kenzi Wang and not by Cere insiders?

Multiple lines of evidence:
- The wallet address was entered into distribution records by a user whose account was subsequently deleted — not by any current team member.
- Mr. Wang was the exclusive intermediary for Ms. Liu and explicitly took ownership of all communication with her.
- The tokens were moved out within eight hours of receipt — inconsistent with normal investor behavior.
- The tokens were eventually laundered through bridges and sold across four international exchanges in a pattern consistent with illicit liquidation, not legitimate investment activity.
- Professional blockchain forensic analysis is underway to produce court-admissible documentation of the full chain of custody.

### Q: Is Vivian Liu part of the scheme?

We are evaluating this carefully. Ms. Liu may be a victim of Mr. Wang's manipulation, or she may be a willing participant. The legal process will determine this. What we know for certain is that Mr. Wang orchestrated the complaint and that the tokens were stolen through a process he controlled.

### Q: Does this affect Cere's operations or product development?

**No.** Our team continues to build, ship, and deliver on our roadmap. Legal matters are being handled by experienced counsel across multiple jurisdictions. This situation, while unfortunate, does not impact our technology, our partnerships, or our commitment to our investors.

### Q: What should I do if I'm contacted by media or opposing counsel?

Please direct any media inquiries or legal communications to our legal team. Do not engage with opposing counsel directly. If you have concerns, reach out to us — we are happy to provide additional context.

### Q: Will there be further updates?

Yes. We will communicate material developments to our investor community, including the outcome of the February 26 Dubai court ruling and the filing of our counterclaims. We are committed to transparency and will continue to let the facts speak for themselves.
