# The Cere Network Story CoinDesk Didn't Tell: How Kenzi Wang Allegedly Stole 33 Million Tokens and Blamed the Victims

*An investigation into on-chain evidence, a Dubai arrest, and the real story behind the $100M lawsuit*

On January 29, 2026, CoinDesk published a headline that ricocheted across Crypto Twitter: *"Investors accuse Cere Network of $100M fraud and token-dump scheme."* The article painted Cere Network founder Fred Jin as the "ringleader" of a massive fraud. It quoted court filings. It sounded damning.

But the article had a glaring omission: it told only one side of the story.

What CoinDesk didn't report — and what on-chain evidence, court records, and a criminal arrest in Dubai now reveal — is that the person behind the lawsuit may be the actual perpetrator of the theft he's accusing others of committing.

His name is Kenzi Wang.

## Who Is Kenzi Wang?

Kenzi Wang is the co-founder of AU21 Capital, a crypto investment fund. He served as an advisor and investor in Cere Network, a blockchain infrastructure project with over 5,000 retail investors on the Republic platform and more than 160 private investors.

Wang's crypto career, however, tells a different story than his LinkedIn profile suggests.

His first notable project, **SuperBloom** (2017–2018), earned a **scam warning from BitcoinTalk moderators**. The SEED token became worthless. His own co-founder, Emmie Chang, later called him publicly *"The Tinder Swindler of crypto."*

He claimed to have been a **General Partner at a16z Crypto** — one of the most prestigious venture capital firms in the world. He does not appear on their team page. Three independent sources confirm he was never employed there.

He claimed to be **CEO of hadron.cloud**. Multiple sources confirm the actual CEO was Cliff Szu.

His fund, now called **Symbolic Capital**, was previously **Hyperedge Capital** — a name change that conveniently resets the search history. The Crunchbase URL still reveals the old name.

This matters because the CoinDesk article treats Wang's accusations at face value. Understanding who he is provides critical context.

## What Actually Happened to Vivian Liu's Tokens

At the center of the $100M lawsuit is Vivian Liu, a private investor who was entitled to exactly 33,333,334 CERE tokens.

Here's what the blockchain records show:

**December 2021:** Kenzi Wang volunteered to be Vivian Liu's sole point of contact with Cere Network. On December 23, he wrote in internal communications: *"I'll handle Vivian and Jacky."* From that moment forward, no one at Cere spoke directly with Vivian. Everything went through Kenzi.

**The cover story:** Kenzi told the Cere team that Vivian was pregnant and difficult to reach, and that she wanted her tokens staked. This explained why there were no signed documents, no wallet address provided directly by Vivian, and no need for anyone to verify anything with her personally.

**The wallet swap:** A wallet address was entered into Cere's distribution spreadsheet — the Google Sheet tracking which investor receives tokens at which address. The address entered: `6R1GPxm3jqiRgjFXkFGLWh2XbcwZysRgXWmZjsyq43pSrwFu`. This was **not Vivian's wallet**. She never provided it.

Google Sheets edit history shows the address was entered by a **"deleted user"** — later identified as Andrei Kinstler ("AK"), whose Google Workspace account was subsequently wiped. Google retains deleted account data for only 20 days. The evidence destruction was precisely timed.

**The distribution:** Cere's team, unaware of the substitution, sent 33,333,334 CERE tokens to that address in three tranches.

## The On-Chain Evidence

What happened next is recorded permanently on the blockchain. Anyone can verify it.

**Within 8 hours** of the tokens arriving, the wallet was emptied. First a test transaction of 2 CERE. Then 3.33 million. Then 30 million in a single transfer. The wallet was left with 1.73 CERE — less than a cent.

No legitimate investor empties their wallet within eight hours of receiving tokens. This was someone who was ready and waiting.

**26 days later**, the full 33.3 million CERE moved to a third wallet — one with 873 prior transactions. A heavily used address belonging to someone experienced in crypto operations.

**January 2024 — nearly two years later** — the tokens began moving again. They were bridged from the Cere network to Polygon, then to Ethereum. First a test of 33,333 CERE on January 6. When that worked, the full amount — 33,299,997.97 CERE — followed the next day.

From an Ethereum wallet, the tokens were sold and distributed across **four different exchanges: OKX, ByBit, KuCoin, and Gate**. Four platforms, multiple jurisdictions. This is a textbook laundering pattern: wait, bridge across networks, split across exchanges, convert to fiat.

## The One Exception Among Thousands

Here is perhaps the most telling fact in the entire case:

**More than 5,000 investors** received their CERE tokens through the Republic platform. **Over 160 private investors** received theirs directly. Every single one of them received their tokens without incident.

**Vivian Liu is the only exception.** The only investor whose tokens went to the wrong address. The only investor whose sole point of contact was Kenzi Wang.

If this were a systemic problem at Cere — as the $100M lawsuit implies — you would expect multiple distribution failures. There was exactly one. And Kenzi Wang had positioned himself as the single variable.

## The Counterattack

In January 2026, a $100 million lawsuit was filed on behalf of Vivian Liu against Fred Jin, Cere Network, and several team members. The suit, filed by a small five-attorney firm in Los Angeles, labels Jin as a "ringleader" of fraud.

Shortly after, the CoinDesk article appeared — echoing the lawsuit's framing almost verbatim.

But according to evidence reviewed for this investigation, the lawsuit was orchestrated by Kenzi Wang himself. The man who volunteered to be Vivian's sole contact. The man who told the cover story. The man who ensured no one at Cere ever spoke to Vivian directly.

The alleged thief, using his victim's name to sue the company he stole from. If the evidence holds, it is an audacious reversal — using a $100M legal claim as a smokescreen for a $33M theft.

## Kenzi Wang Is Under Arrest in Dubai

What CoinDesk also failed to report: **Kenzi Wang has been arrested in Dubai.**

He was detained and interrogated. His passport was confiscated. A **travel ban** is active — he cannot leave the country. Two criminal cases (31801/2025 and 33359/2025) have been referred to the **Dubai Criminal Court**. The charges relate to theft of Cere's social media accounts and defamatory statements. A ruling is expected on **February 26, 2026**. If convicted, he faces up to five years in prison.

This is not a corporate dispute being litigated in civil court. This is a criminal case with an arrest, a travel ban, and a court date.

## The Broader Pattern

The Cere case is not isolated. Public records, court filings, and on-the-record statements from former associates paint a picture of systematic behavior:

- **SuperBloom (2017–2018):** Scam-flagged on BitcoinTalk. Token worthless.
- **Grand Theft charge in San Francisco (2018):** Case number 18017577. A felony-level charge, years before the Cere allegations.
- **AU21 Capital portfolio:** Multiple investments with catastrophic losses — VegaSwap (total loss), Youclout (99.8% loss), AvaXlauncher (97% loss), Dragon Kart (99.1% loss, zero volume).
- **Kylin Network:** Wang invested via AU21 while secretly funding and controlling Paralink, a direct competitor. Dylan Dewdney, Kylin's founder, is willing to testify under oath. Screenshots from December 2021 and January 2022 confirm Wang's control of Paralink.
- **Cere influencer sale theft:** Before the Vivian token theft came to light, Cere sued Wang in federal court (N.D. California) in May 2023 for **$1.3 million** in stolen proceeds from influencer token sales he conducted on Cere's behalf. He collected the crypto payments and simply kept them.

## All Active Legal Proceedings

For the record, these are the currently active cases involving Kenzi Wang:

1. **Dubai Criminal Court** — Two cases (31801/2025, 33359/2025). Arrested, travel ban active. Ruling February 26, 2026.
2. **Cere vs. Wang (N.D. California)** — Civil claim for $1.3M in stolen influencer sale proceeds (filed 2023). Now being expanded to include the Vivian token theft via counterclaim.
3. **Vivian Liu vs. Cere ($100M)** — Filed January 2026. Small LA firm. Cere's legal team is preparing a counterclaim.
4. **Interdata vs. Wang, Nailwal, Hu (N.D. Cal., Case 3:25-cv-03798)** — Federal case also naming Sandeep Nailwal (Polygon co-founder) as a defendant. Wang and Nailwal share the same attorney, David Sergenian, and co-founded Symbolic Capital together.
5. **San Francisco Grand Theft (2018)** — Case 18017577.

## What Comes Next

Cere Network's legal team — led by Rocky Dhir as lead counsel, with Matt Miller and co-counsel — is preparing a counterclaim that specifically traces the token theft using blockchain forensics. Nine specialized blockchain analysis firms have been identified, with proposals from **Chainalysis, TRM Labs, and Elliptic** — the industry's gold standard. Budget: $15,000–$50,000.

Additionally, four exchanges — ByBit, OKX, KuCoin, and Gate — handled the cash-out. Through the Dubai legal proceedings, these exchanges may be compelled to disclose the identity behind the Ethereum wallet that sold the tokens. That's the final piece: a name attached to the wallet.

## The Question CoinDesk Should Have Asked

The CoinDesk article presented Vivian Liu's lawsuit as a straightforward fraud allegation against Cere Network. It didn't ask why Vivian was the only investor — out of more than 5,000 — who didn't receive her tokens. It didn't ask who introduced the fraudulent wallet address. It didn't mention that Kenzi Wang, the man behind the lawsuit, had been arrested in Dubai. It didn't note his prior Grand Theft charge, his scam-flagged first project, or the $1.3M he already stole from Cere.

Responsible journalism requires presenting evidence from both sides. The on-chain data is public. The court records are public. The arrest is documented. The pattern is clear.

The blockchain doesn't forget. And the story CoinDesk didn't tell may turn out to be the real one.
