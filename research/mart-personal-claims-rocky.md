# PRIVILEGED & CONFIDENTIAL — ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION

# Personal Claims of Martijn Broersma Against Kenzi Wang and Lujunjin "Vivian" Liu

**Prepared for:** Rocky Lee, Milliard Law
**Date:** February 4, 2026
**Subject:** Evaluation of personal causes of action available to Martijn Broersma, individually, arising from coordinated defamatory litigation and media campaign

---

## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Martijn Broersma ("Mart") has been personally named as a defendant in *Goopal Digital Ltd. v. Jin et al.*, Case No. 3:26-cv-00857 (N.D. Cal.), in a $100 million RICO and fraud complaint that includes 10 causes of action. His name and photograph have been published in major crypto media outlets (CoinDesk, Law360, and others) under headlines such as *"Brad Bao Sued by Goopal Digital Over $58M Looting Scheme"* — directly associating him with criminal conduct.

The evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that:
1. Mart was an **independent contractor/consultant** — not a CMO, officer, or signatory
2. The underlying scheme was orchestrated by **Kenzi Wang**, not Mart or any other named defendant
3. The lawsuit was filed as a **coordinated weapon** by Kenzi through Vivian Liu to deflect from his own criminal exposure in Dubai

Mart seeks to pursue **personal claims** against both Kenzi Wang and Vivian Liu for the reputational, professional, and personal harm caused by this campaign.

## II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND — MART'S ACTUAL ROLE

### A. Consulting Agreement (August 20, 2020)
Mart's engagement with Cerebellum Network was governed by a Consulting Agreement that explicitly states:

- **Title:** "Senior/lead developer" — **NOT** CMO
- **Status:** Independent contractor — **NOT** officer or employee
- **Section 7.A:** *"Consultant is not authorized to bind the Company to any liability or obligation or to represent that Consultant has any such authority."*
- **No director appointment**, no board resolution, no signing authority, no corporate officer designation exists in any corporate record

### B. Token Distribution Role
- Mart's role in token distribution was **administrative** — entering ERC-20 wallet addresses received from investors into a Google Sheets mastersheet
- Mainnet distributions were handled by another team member (AK)
- Mart had **no multi-sig signing authority** on Fireblocks or any treasury wallet
- Over 5,000+ investors received tokens through this process without incident — Vivian Liu is the sole exception

### C. Gotbit Market Making — Zero Involvement
The complaint (Allegation 85) alleges the Gotbit arrangement was "negotiated by Broersma and Jin." This is demonstrably false:

- **Telegram Evidence ("Cere x Gotbit" group, 2021-2022):** Kenzi Wang coordinated the original Gotbit relationship — set up Gate sub-accounts, provided listing price (0.035), supplied company details (Interdata Network Inc, BVI), and asked Gotbit to also do market making for bitcoin.com
- **Telegram Evidence ("Cere x gotbit NEW" group, Apr-May 2022):** Fred Jin was the **only** Cere representative communicating with Gotbit. Alex (Gotbit owner) addressed Fred directly: *"you asked me to fix this situation on your market."* Fred scheduled calls, received proposals, provided his email (fred@cere.network)
- **Mart has ZERO messages in either Telegram group.** He is mentioned once by a third party (@broersma) but never participated in any conversation about Gotbit

### D. Vivian Liu Token Theft — Kenzi's "Booby Trap"
- **December 23, 2021:** Kenzi Wang states in Slack: *"I'll handle Vivian"* / *"I'll take Vivian and Jacky"*
- **May 2022:** A fake Cere mainnet wallet address is entered into the distribution mastersheet by a **"deleted user"** (Google Sheets edit history — no current team member associated)
- **Vivian Liu confirms she never provided this wallet address**
- Tokens sent to this fake wallet were drained using a **test-then-sweep pattern** (2 CERE test → 3.3M sweep → 30M main sweep → 1 CERE dust cleanup) — operational theft behavior
- Tokens were bridged to Ethereum and **immediately sent to KuCoin** — total: 33,333,330.97 CERE
- The bridge wallet (0xb08f...9f00) was **funded by Kenzi's identified wallet** (0x0d0707...b492fe) in Feb 2024
- The bridge wallet also claimed **RAZE and SKYRIM tokens** — both AU21 Capital portfolio projects (Kenzi's fund)

## III. PERSONAL HARM TO MARTIJN BROERSMA

### A. Reputational Damage
1. **Media publications** featuring Mart's name and photograph in connection with "looting," "fraud," and "RICO racketeering" — permanently indexed by search engines
2. **CoinDesk article** (Jan 29, 2026): *"Investors accuse Cere Network of $100M fraud"* — published without requesting comment from Mart individually, calling Fred Jin "ringleader" and naming all defendants
3. **Law360 article** (Jan 27, 2026): Published before deadline for comment expired
4. Articles are being **forwarded socially** — Mart's wife (Charlotte) received the article from a friend on February 4, 2026, demonstrating real-world reputational propagation

### B. Professional Harm
1. Mart is actively building Proofi.ai — a verifiable credentials platform. His name appearing in "$100M fraud" headlines directly undermines trust in his new venture
2. Future employment, partnerships, and investor relationships are compromised by searchable fraud allegations
3. The RICO allegation specifically carries severe stigma — implying criminal enterprise participation

### C. Personal and Emotional Harm
1. Mart's wife learning about the allegations through social forwarding — not from Mart himself
2. The stress and anxiety of being named in a $100M lawsuit with RICO charges
3. Legal costs of personal defense as an individual (not covered by corporate D&O unless confirmed)

## IV. PROPOSED CAUSES OF ACTION

### A. Against Kenzi Wang

#### 1. DUBAI — Criminal Defamation (Addition to Existing Case)
- **Basis:** UAE Penal Code Articles 372-373 (defamation), Article 399 (false accusation)
- **Strength:** Kenzi is already subject to criminal proceedings in Dubai with an active travel ban. The Dubai prosecutor has already established Kenzi's pattern of defamation against Cere and its principals
- **Specific acts:** Orchestrating the Goopal complaint and associated media campaign naming Mart personally, knowing the allegations against Mart to be false
- **Request:** Add Mart as a named complainant/victim in the existing Dubai criminal proceedings; alternatively, file a separate criminal complaint for defamation
- **Advantage:** Dubai courts take defamation extremely seriously; criminal conviction strengthens all civil claims; Kenzi is already within jurisdiction

#### 2. DUBAI — Civil Defamation & Damages
- **Basis:** UAE Civil Code — tortious act causing reputational harm
- **Damages:** Reputational harm, professional harm, emotional distress, legal costs
- **Enforcement:** Kenzi has assets and presence in Dubai; judgment directly enforceable

#### 3. US — Abuse of Process (N.D. California)
- **Basis:** Kenzi used Vivian Liu as a proxy to file litigation with the **primary purpose of harassing and causing reputational damage** to defendants, not to obtain a legitimate judicial remedy
- **Evidence:**
  - Kenzi orchestrated Vivian's claims (Slack: "I'll handle Vivian")
  - Kenzi stole Vivian's tokens and then directed her to sue Cere (the "booby trap")
  - The complaint contains allegations against Mart that are demonstrably false (CMO title, Gotbit involvement, signing authority)
  - Media outreach was coordinated to maximize publicity before defendants could respond
- **Timing:** Can be filed as counterclaim/cross-claim in the existing Goopal case

#### 4. US — Defamation Per Se (California)
- **Basis:** Statements made **outside of court filings** — specifically the media campaign, press coordination, and social media dissemination attributable to Kenzi
- **Note:** Statements within court filings are protected by litigation privilege (Cal. Civ. Code § 47(b)), BUT statements to media, on social media, or through third-party coordination are NOT privileged
- **Per se categories:** Accusations of criminal conduct (RICO, fraud, theft) and unfitness for profession — no need to prove special damages
- **Challenge:** Must attribute specific extra-judicial statements to Kenzi directly

#### 5. US — Civil Conspiracy
- **Basis:** Kenzi and Vivian acted in concert to file a baseless lawsuit and orchestrate a media campaign designed to harm Mart and other defendants
- **Evidence:** Kenzi's control over Vivian's wallet, his Slack statements, the coordinated timing of filing + media outreach

#### 6. US — Tortious Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage
- **Basis:** The media campaign arising from the baseless lawsuit interferes with Mart's ability to:
  - Raise capital for Proofi.ai
  - Establish business partnerships
  - Maintain professional reputation in the blockchain industry
- **Knowledge:** Kenzi, as a former Cere co-founder, is fully aware of Mart's professional activities

### B. Against Vivian Liu

#### 1. US — Malicious Prosecution (after favorable termination)
- **Basis:** If the Goopal case is dismissed or Mart prevails, Vivian filed the action:
  - Without probable cause (the specific allegations against Mart are demonstrably false)
  - With malice (coordinated with Kenzi to maximize reputational harm)
- **Timing:** Can only be filed after favorable termination of the underlying case
- **Fee recovery:** Successful malicious prosecution claim recovers all defense costs

#### 2. US — California Anti-SLAPP Motion (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16)
- **Basis:** If any of Vivian's claims against Mart arise from protected activity (public statements about Cere's technology/business), Mart can bring an early anti-SLAPP motion
- **Effect:** If granted — early dismissal of claims against Mart + **mandatory attorney fee award**
- **Strategic value:** Fastest path to personal exoneration + cost recovery
- **Assessment:** Requires careful analysis of which specific claims target Mart's speech vs. alleged conduct

#### 3. US — Abuse of Process
- **Basis:** Same as against Kenzi — Vivian knowingly participated in filing claims she knew or should have known were false regarding Mart's role
- **Evidence:** Vivian confirmed she never provided the wallet address that received her tokens — yet her complaint blames Mart and other defendants rather than the person who actually controlled that wallet (Kenzi)

## V. JURISDICTIONAL ANALYSIS

| Jurisdiction | Defendants | Strength | Speed | Enforceability | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Dubai Criminal** | Kenzi | ★★★★☆ | Fast (existing case) | High (Kenzi in Dubai) | Low (piggyback) |
| **Dubai Civil** | Kenzi | ★★★★☆ | Medium | High | Medium |
| **US - N.D. Cal** | Both | ★★★☆☆ | Slow (after main case) | Medium | High |
| **US - Anti-SLAPP** | Vivian | ★★★☆☆ | Fast (early motion) | High (fee award) | Medium |
| **Netherlands** | Both | ★★☆☆☆ | Medium | Low (cross-border) | Medium |

---

## VI. RECOMMENDED PRIORITY

### Immediate (Before Feb 26, 2026 — Dubai Hearing)
1. **Add Mart as personal complainant in Dubai criminal proceedings** — defamation and false accusation. The Feb 26 hearing is the deadline for maximum impact.
2. **File formal victim impact statement** documenting personal reputational harm (media articles, social forwarding to family members)

### Short-term (Within 30 days)
3. **Evaluate Anti-SLAPP motion** for Mart individually in the Goopal case — if viable, this is the fastest path to dismissal + fee recovery
4. **Preserve evidence** of extra-judicial defamation attributable to Kenzi (social media posts, media coordination, third-party communications)

### Medium-term (3-6 months)
5. **File abuse of process / civil conspiracy claims** against Kenzi in N.D. Cal (can be added as cross-claims in existing case)
6. **Tortious interference claim** as Proofi.ai launches and Mart can document specific business impact

### After Favorable Termination
7. **Malicious prosecution** against both Kenzi and Vivian — recovers all personal legal costs

---

## VII. KEY EVIDENCE TO PRESERVE / OBTAIN

1. ☐ All media articles naming Mart with publication dates and screenshots
2. ☐ Social media forwarding evidence (Charlotte receiving article from friend — Feb 4, 2026)
3. ☐ Mart's Consulting Agreement (Aug 20, 2020) — "NOT authorized to bind"
4. ☐ Corporate records confirming no CMO appointment, no board resolution, no officer designation
5. ☐ Gotbit Telegram screenshots (both groups) — Mart's complete absence
6. ☐ Kenzi Slack messages ("I'll handle Vivian" — Dec 23, 2021)
7. ☐ Google Sheets edit history — "deleted user" wallet entry
8. ☐ Chain analysis: bridge wallet funded by Kenzi's wallet (0x0d0707...b492fe)
9. ☐ Vivian's own confirmation she never provided the wallet address
10. ☐ Any communications from Kenzi directing or coordinating with Vivian on the lawsuit

## VIII. QUESTIONS FOR ROCKY

1. Can Mart be added as a personal complainant to the existing Dubai criminal case before the Feb 26 hearing?
2. Is there a separate filing required, or can this be done via supplemental submission through Dubai counsel?
3. What is the viability of an Anti-SLAPP motion for Mart individually given the specific allegations against him?
4. Does D&O insurance cover Mart's personal counterclaims, or only his defense?
5. Should we engage a Dubai civil lawyer in parallel for a personal damages claim?
6. What discovery in the Goopal case could support Mart's personal claims (e.g., communications between Kenzi and Vivian, communications between Kenzi and plaintiff's counsel)?
