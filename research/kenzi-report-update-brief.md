- **Reef Finance (Denko Manceski)**: Another victim
- **"Whole Telegram group of people wronged by Kenzi Wang"** (per Source 1)

Keeps doxxing you and saying 'I'm a cofounder, I have these rights, if you don't send me money I will go after you.'" Then has Singapore law firm send threatening letters.
