# Twitter/X Thread — The Cere Network Story CoinDesk Didn't Tell

---

**1/**
Everyone's talking about the $100M Cere Network "fraud." Here's what CoinDesk didn't tell you 🧵

**2/**
CoinDesk published "Investors accuse Cere Network of $100M fraud" on Jan 29, 2026. It painted Fred Jin as a "ringleader." One-sided. No comment from Cere. No mention of the arrest in Dubai.

Let me tell you what actually happened.

**3/**
At the center of this story is Kenzi Wang — co-founder of AU21 Capital, advisor to Cere Network. He volunteered to be the SOLE contact person for investor Vivian Liu.

On Dec 23, 2021, he wrote: "I'll handle Vivian and Jacky."

No one at Cere spoke to Vivian again.

**4/**
Kenzi told the team Vivian was pregnant and hard to reach. She wanted her tokens "staked," he said. No signed docs needed. No wallet address from Vivian directly. No verification required.

The perfect cover story.

**5/**
A wallet address was entered in Cere's distribution spreadsheet. But it wasn't Vivian's wallet. She never provided it.

Google Sheets edit history shows it was entered by a "deleted user" — later identified as Andrei Kinstler, whose account was wiped within Google's 20-day data retention window.

**6/**
Cere's team — unaware of the swap — sent all 33,333,334 CERE tokens to that address in three tranches.

Every single token Vivian was owed. Sent to a wallet she never controlled.

**7/**
Here's where it gets damning.

Within 8 HOURS of receiving the tokens, the wallet was emptied.

First: a test transaction of 2 CERE.
Then: 3.33M CERE.
Then: 30M CERE in one shot.

Remaining balance: 1.73 CERE. Less than a cent.

**8/**
No real investor empties their wallet 8 hours after receiving tokens. This was someone who was ready and waiting. Someone who knew exactly when the tokens would arrive.

**9/**
26 days later: all 33.3M tokens moved to a THIRD wallet — one with 873 prior transactions. A power user. Someone who knew exactly what they were doing.

Then silence. For almost two years.

**10/**
January 2024: the tokens start moving again.

Bridged from Cere network → Polygon → Ethereum.

First a test: 33,333 CERE on Jan 6.
Then the full amount: 33,299,997.97 CERE the next day.

Classic laundering: test small, then move everything.

**11/**
From the Ethereum wallet, the tokens were sold across FOUR exchanges:
• OKX
• ByBit
• KuCoin
• Gate

Four platforms. Multiple jurisdictions. Split to avoid detection. This is textbook money laundering.

**12/**
Now here's the stat that blows the whole "Cere is a fraud" narrative apart:

Over 5,000 investors via Republic ✅
Over 160 private investors ✅
ALL received their tokens. Zero issues.

Vivian Liu is the ONLY exception. The only one where Kenzi was the middleman.

**13/**
If Cere were running a fraud, why would they successfully distribute to 5,000+ investors and scam exactly ONE — the one whose sole contact happened to be Kenzi Wang?

That's not fraud. That's a theft with a very specific perpetrator.

**14/**
It gets worse. In January 2026, a $100M lawsuit was filed "on behalf of" Vivian Liu against Fred Jin and Cere.

Filed by a tiny 5-attorney firm in LA.

But who was behind the lawsuit? Kenzi Wang. The same man who positioned himself as Vivian's only link to Cere.

**15/**
Read that again.

The man who:
- Isolated the investor ✓
- Created the cover story ✓
- Controlled the communication channel ✓
- Had motive and access ✓

...then used his alleged VICTIM'S name to sue the company he stole from. A $100M smokescreen for a $33M theft.

**16/**
What CoinDesk REALLY didn't tell you:

🚨 Kenzi Wang has been ARRESTED in Dubai 🚨

Detained. Interrogated. Passport confiscated. Active travel ban — he cannot leave the country.

Two criminal cases referred to Dubai Criminal Court. Ruling: Feb 26, 2026.

**17/**
And this isn't his first rodeo.

• SuperBloom (2017): SCAM WARNING on BitcoinTalk. Token worthless. His own co-founder called him "The Tinder Swindler of crypto."

• Grand Theft charge in San Francisco (2018): Case #18017577. A felony.

**18/**
His fund AU21 Capital? A graveyard:

• VegaSwap: total loss
• Youclout: -99.8%
• AvaXlauncher: -97%
• Dragon Kart: -99.1%, zero volume

Pattern: invest early, dump tokens on retail, abandon the project. Rinse, repeat.

**19/**
He also invested in Kylin Network — then secretly funded Paralink, a DIRECT competitor. Used insider knowledge from his investment to build a rival project.

Kylin's founder Dylan Dewdney is willing to testify under oath. Screenshots confirm Kenzi controlled Paralink.

**20/**
His CV is fiction too:

❌ "General Partner at a16z Crypto" — Never on their team page
❌ "CEO of hadron.cloud" — Real CEO was Cliff Szu
❌ "Acquired Traction Labs" — The TechCrunch link he cites is a 404
❌ "Symbolic Capital" — Actually renamed from Hyperedge Capital to erase history

**21/**
Before the Vivian theft even came to light, Cere already sued Kenzi in federal court (N.D. California, 2023) for $1.3M he stole from influencer token sales he ran on their behalf.

He collected the payments and just... kept them. He doesn't steal once. He steals structurally.

**22/**
Active legal proceedings against Kenzi Wang right now:

⚖️ Dubai Criminal Court — 2 cases, arrested, travel ban
⚖️ Cere vs Wang (N.D. Cal) — $1.3M theft
⚖️ Vivian Liu vs Cere — $100M (orchestrated by Kenzi himself)
⚖️ Interdata vs Wang, Nailwal, Hu — Federal
⚖️ SF Grand Theft (2018)

**23/**
Cere's legal team is now deploying professional blockchain forensics — Chainalysis, TRM Labs, Elliptic — to trace every single token from the fake wallet through the bridges to the exchanges.

Four exchanges may be compelled via Dubai courts to reveal who cashed out.

The final puzzle piece.

**24/**
CoinDesk ran a one-sided story. No mention of:
- The Dubai arrest
- The on-chain evidence
- The 5,000 investors who got their tokens
- Kenzi's criminal history
- The $1.3M he already stole from Cere
- His scam-flagged first project

That's not journalism. That's a press release.

**25/**
Kenzi Wang is arrested in Dubai. He can't leave the country. Criminal court rules Feb 26.

The blockchain never forgets. Every transaction is recorded. Every bridge. Every exchange.

The real story is just beginning.
