# Compensation Proposal: Martijn Broersma
**Cere Network / CEF.ai — January 2026**

---

## Executive Summary

Over 5+ years, my role has evolved from a $5K/month developer contract into a multi-function leadership position spanning engineering, HR operations, legal crisis management, and corporate governance — without any corresponding adjustment to title, compensation, or equity. My current $150K base with zero token allocation is significantly below market for *any single one* of these functions, let alone the combination. This proposal requests a market correction to $190K base + token grant + a one-time crisis bonus, bringing total compensation in line with the value delivered.

## Role Evolution: 2020 → 2026

| Period | Scope | Effective Role |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| **Aug 2020** | Cere Consulting Agreement: $5K/month, Senior/Lead Developer | Developer |
| **2021–2022** | Expanded into DevOps, CI/CD, infrastructure automation | Senior Engineer + DevOps Lead |
| **2023** | Took over HR pipeline, built recruiting automation, Notion systems | +Head of Recruiting Ops |
| **2024 H1** | Led Kenzi Wang forensic investigation, coordinated 3 law firms across 3 jurisdictions | +Crisis/Legal PM |
| **2024 H2** | DAO governance restructuring, entity transitions, CoinDesk crisis response, foundation payments | +Head of Operations |
| **2025** | Full-stack: engineering, HR automation (v3), outbound campaigns, onboarding, corporate governance, marketing | Chief of Staff / COO-equivalent |

**Key point:** My title and comp have not changed since 2020. My scope has expanded ~5x.

## Market Benchmarks

### Chief of Staff — Crypto/Web3

| Source | Data Point |
|--------|-----------|
| Chief of Staff Network 2025 Report | Mean salary: **$167,954** (up from $154,673 in 2024). 23.8% earn >$200K. |
| Top-quartile (tech/crypto) | **$200K–$300K+** base, plus 0.25–1% equity |
| Status (Web3 company, remote) | Listed $72–87K — but this is an outlier for a non-profit/DAO org |

### Senior Engineering Manager — Web3

| Source | Data Point |
|--------|-----------|
| The Crypto Recruiters 2025 Benchmark | Senior/Lead Full-Stack Web3: **$200K** |
| Smart Contract Engineer (Senior) | **$230K+** |
| Protocol/Head of Engineering | **$300–375K+** |
| US mid-level Web3 average | **$145K** (I'm well past mid-level at 5+ years) |

### Head of Operations — Crypto

| Source | Data Point |
|--------|-----------|
| Web3 Head of Marketing (comparable ops scope) | Senior: **$210K+** |
| Crypto Product Manager (Senior) | **$190K** |
| Carta H1 2025 Startup Comp Report | Average startup salaries up **5.8%** since 2022, trend accelerating |

### Forensic Blockchain Investigation — External Rates

| Service | Cost |
|---------|------|
| CipherBlade / Crystal Intelligence / Chainalysis-certified investigators | **$300–500/hr** |
| Chainalysis software licensing alone | **$50K+ annually** (low 5 figures minimum for basic access) |
| Full forensic investigation + expert witness (multi-chain, multi-jurisdiction) | **$300K–$750K+** for scope comparable to what I did on Kenzi |

### Token/Equity Benchmarks — Web3

| Benchmark | Data |
|-----------|------|
| a16z crypto guidance | 10–20% of total token supply allocated for team compensation |
| Dragonfly Research / Sam Altman framework | ~10% for first 10 employees, ~5% for next 20 |
| Senior individual contributor (typical) | 0.1–2% equity |
| Management / multi-function leadership | 0.5–5% equity |
| 5+ year tenure with no prior equity | Strong case for higher end of range |

---

## Gap Analysis: Current vs. Market

| Component | Current | Market Rate (conservative) | Gap |
|-----------|---------|---------------------------|-----|
| Base salary | $150,000 | $180,000–$220,000 | **-$30K to -$70K** |
| Token/equity | $0 | 0.5–2% token supply | **$0 vs. significant upside** |
| Crisis/project bonus | $0 | $30,000–$50,000 (one-time) | **-$30K to -$50K** |
| **Total comp** | **$150,000** | **$220,000–$280,000+ (cash + equity)** | **Underpaid by 47–87%** |

Even comparing against just the **Chief of Staff mean salary** ($168K) — a single-function role — I'm $18K below market before accounting for equity, bonuses, or the 5 additional functions I perform.

---

## The Proposal

### 1. Base Salary Adjustment: **$190,000/year**

This is deliberately conservative — below the top-quartile for any individual role I perform, and well below what the combined scope would command as separate hires. This number reflects loyalty, the reality of a Series A budget, and a willingness to share upside through tokens.

### 2. Token Grant: **0.75% of total token supply**

- **Vesting:** 2-year schedule, quarterly vesting, no cliff (I've already proven 5+ years of commitment)
- **Rationale:** I've had zero equity exposure despite being one of the longest-tenured team members. By standard frameworks (Dragonfly/a16z), early employees in my position would typically hold 0.5–2%. Starting at 0.75% is moderate.

### 3. Crisis Bonus: **$40,000 one-time payment**

For the Kenzi Wang investigation specifically:
- Multi-chain forensic tracing (Cere mainnet → Polygon → Ethereum → KuCoin)
- Evidence of premeditated test transactions discovered
- Coordination across 3 law firms, 3 jurisdictions (US, Dubai, India)
- CoinDesk crisis response and public communications
- Comparable external forensic investigation would have cost **$300K–$750K+**
- $40K represents ~5–13% of the cost savings

### 4. Title Update: **Chief of Staff** or **VP of Operations**

Reflects actual scope. Costs the company nothing.

### Summary

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Base salary | $190,000/year |
| Token grant | 0.75% total supply (2yr vest) |
| Crisis bonus | $40,000 (one-time) |
| **Year 1 total cash** | **$230,000** |
| **Ongoing annual** | **$190,000 + vesting tokens** |

## ROI: What This Role Has Saved and Generated

### HR Automation System (replacement value: 2–3 FTEs)

| What I built/run | What it replaces |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| HR Funnel Monitor v3 (Railway, auto-deploy) | Recruiting coordinator ($60–80K) |
| AI candidate scoring (Gemini Flash, 6 role prompts, 3x daily cron) | Technical screener ($80–120K) |
| Slack alert system (hot candidates, stale pipeline, system health) | Recruiting ops manager ($70–100K) |
| Outbound campaigns (Clay: 128+ blockchain engineers, 6,291+ principal engineers) | Sourcer ($60–80K) |
| Source tracking & attribution | Analytics tool ($20–40K/yr) |

**Conservative replacement cost: $200–350K/year** in headcount + tools, running continuously with near-zero marginal cost.

### Legal & Crisis Management (replacement value: $300K–$750K+)

| Deliverable | External equivalent cost |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Multi-chain forensic investigation | $150–300K (CipherBlade / Chainalysis-certified firm) |
| Multi-jurisdiction legal coordination (3 firms, US/Dubai/India) | $100–200K (senior legal PM) |
| CoinDesk crisis response & communications | $50–100K (crisis PR firm) |
| Evidence memos, correction letters, public statements | $30–50K (legal writing) |

**One-time savings: $300–650K+** — and the investigation is ongoing, continuing to generate value.

### Operations & Governance

- DAO restructuring, entity transitions, foundation payments — work that would require an outside counsel or operations consultant at **$250–500/hr**
- Onboarding and knowledge transfer (Bren, Patrick) — reducing ramp time and preserving institutional knowledge

### Total Annual Value Delivered

| Category | Estimated Value |
|----------|----------------|
| HR automation (ongoing) | $200–350K/year |
| Legal/crisis (one-time + ongoing) | $300–650K |
| Ops/governance (ongoing) | $100–200K/year |
| **Total (Year 1)** | **$600K–$1.2M** |

**My proposed comp ($230K Year 1) represents 19–38% of the value I deliver.** That's an exceptional ROI for the company.

## The Ask

Fred — I've been all-in on Cere for over five years. I've done whatever needed doing, from code to legal investigations to crisis management, without ever asking for a title change or raise. The scope of my work today bears no resemblance to the developer contract I signed in 2020.

I'm not asking to be paid like six people. I'm asking to be compensated fairly as one person doing the work of several — at a rate that's still well below what any of these functions would cost separately.

**Specifically:**

1. **$190K base** — effective immediately
2. **0.75% token grant** — 2-year vest, quarterly, no cliff
3. **$40K crisis bonus** — one-time, for the Kenzi investigation
4. **Title: Chief of Staff** (or VP Operations)

This is a market correction, not a raise. I'm committed to Cere's success and want to keep building — but the compensation gap needs to close.
