## 7. NARRATIVE SUMMARY — "THE REAL STORY"

The email evidence tells a consistent story across 2+ years:

1. **Mart and Fred were the INVESTIGATORS, not the perpetrators.** From Dec 2023 (Mart reaching out to Andrei/Kinstler about suspicious wallet) through Feb 2026 (compiling evidence for HansonBrigett), they have been relentlessly investigating Kenzi's fraud.

2. **Four independent investigations cleared Fred:** Practus LLP (March-July 2024), DHTY (Feb 2024), Ascent Fund Services (Dec 2023), and QRI private investigator (2025). Not one of these investigations found evidence supporting Kenzi's allegations.

3. **Mart was never threatening or intimidating.** His communications with former employees (Andrei, Kinstler) were professional, friendly ("Hey mate, hope ur good!"), and investigative. He shared blockchain evidence and asked for help.

4. **The entities were real.** Board resolutions, Chase Bank accounts, Reg D/Reg S memorandums, exchange listing agreements, DAOmaker SHO, Expedia contracts — these are not things shell companies have.

5. **Kenzi admitted** (in his own Motion to Strike) that he refused to return social media accounts. He was arrested in Dubai for social media hijacking and defamation. He has a Grand Theft charge from 2018.

6. **The Goopal lawsuit was orchestrated by the thief.** Kenzi stole Vivian's tokens AND directed her to sue Cere — the classic DARVO pattern (Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender).
