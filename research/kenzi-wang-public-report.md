# The $104.9M Crypto Heist: How Serial Fraudster Kenzi Wang Stole Millions, Defrauded 75+ Investors, and Left a Decade-Long Trail of Victims

*The definitive investigation into one of crypto's most brazen insider fraud operations — complete with on-chain evidence, a criminal history spanning back to 2017, multiple lawsuits, active criminal prosecutions, forensic audit findings, and the words of his own victims*

## The Counter-Narrative to Today's CoinDesk Article

Today, CoinDesk published a one-sided article titled ["Investors accuse Cere Network of $100 million fraud and token-dump scheme in lawsuit"](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/01/29/investors-accuse-cere-network-of-usd100m-fraud-and-token-dump-scheme-in-lawsuit), painting Cere Network as the villains in what they present as a straightforward token fraud case. The article calls CEO Fred Jin the "ringleader" and presents only the plaintiff's narrative without contacting Cere for comment.

But there's a critical piece of the story CoinDesk missed—or chose to ignore.

**The blockchain doesn't lie. And it tells a very different story.**

What really happened is that Kenzi Wang—a crypto venture capitalist with insider access to Cere Network—orchestrated an elaborate scheme to steal millions in tokens and investor funds. He directed 75+ investors to send money to his personal wallets, diverted over $4.4 million outside company control, stole 33.3 million CERE tokens belonging to investor Vivian Liu, and destroyed evidence to cover his tracks. When caught, he hijacked the company's social media accounts and filed retaliatory lawsuits accusing others of exactly what *he* had done.

And this wasn't his first time. Kenzi Wang has a documented criminal history going back to at least 2017, including a **Grand Theft charge**, bad-faith arbitration rulings, and a trail of defrauded business partners so long that there's literally a **Telegram group dedicated to his victims**.

As one of his former partners put it: Wang is *"the white-collar crypto version of the Tinder Swindler."*

This is the story the blockchain tells—and the story his victims tell. Every claim is sourced to court filings, forensic audit reports, private investigator reports, board committee reports, or publicly verifiable blockchain data.

## Total Damage: $104,967,900

Before diving into the details, here is the full financial impact of Kenzi Wang's fraud, as documented in board committee reports and forensic audit findings (November 2025):

### Direct Theft: $4,817,900

| Amount | Description | Date | Source |
|--------|-------------|------|--------|
| $2,671,400 USDC | Private funds held in Kenzi's custody on Binance — part of ~$3M "admitted loss" | Jan 19, 2021 | Forensic audit, Board memo |
| $320,000 USDC | Funds raised in remainder of round, part of "black swan" admission | Jan 27, 2021 | Forensic audit, Board memo |
| $1,382,000 USDC | Funds discovered in unapproved wallets — part of ~$1.7M undisclosed | Apr 8, 2023 | Forensic audit |
| $444,500 USDC | Shadow admin gap remainder | May 9, 2023 | Forensic audit |

Wang himself acknowledged a ~$3 million loss in what he called a "black swan event." But a forensic audit uncovered an additional ~$1.7 million in previously undisclosed diversions — funds sitting in wallets Wang controlled that the company never authorized.

### Lost OTC/Subscription Revenue: $100,150,000

Wang's fraud didn't just steal existing funds — it destroyed the company's ability to raise capital. According to board committee reports, **13+ institutional OTC investors** withdrew or were unable to proceed with deals ranging from $2.5 million to $15 million each, directly because of the chaos, legal exposure, and reputational damage caused by Wang's actions. At the network's $1 billion valuation ($0.10/token), the total lost deal flow totaled **$100,150,000**.

### Grand Total: $104,967,900

## Who Is Kenzi Wang? A Decade of Fraud

**Full name:** Kenzi Wang, also known as Jin Wang
**Background:** Former VP/GM at Huobi Global (operations, business development, marketing, venture, listings) — reportedly **fired for "many bad reasons"** (per investor Vijay Garg's account in private investigator interviews)
**Current role:** Co-founder of AU21 Capital (established 2017, San Francisco) alongside Chandler Guo
**Relationship to Cere:** Was an investor and advisor to Cere Network through AU21 Capital
**Criminal record:** Grand Theft charge (2018), bad-faith arbitration ruling (2017), multiple civil suits
**Current legal status:** Defendant in multiple US lawsuits; subject of two criminal cases referred to Dubai Criminal Court; arrested in Dubai, released on bail after surrendering passport

Kenzi Wang isn't some random bad actor. He's a well-connected crypto insider with deep relationships across the industry, particularly in Asia. His background at Huobi Global gave him extensive knowledge of how token distributions, exchange operations, and blockchain infrastructure work. This expertise would prove crucial to his schemes.

But perhaps most important is his partnership with Chandler Guo in AU21 Capital. Because Chandler Guo co-founded Gate.io, one of the major cryptocurrency exchanges that would become central to laundering the stolen tokens.

### Criminal History: The Pattern Was There All Along

A thorough background investigation by private investigators revealed a pattern of fraudulent behavior stretching back at least to 2017. This is not a one-time lapse in judgment. This is a serial fraudster.

**2017 — Bad Faith Domain Registration**
A FORUM arbitration panel (Case No. FA1709001750913) found that Wang acted in **"bad faith"** when he registered domain names confusingly similar to competitor Traction Corp. After being caught, Wang agreed to a settlement — then reneged and demanded more money. This is the earliest documented instance of what would become his signature pattern: make a deal, break the deal, then extort.

**2017 — Stafftopia/ERG v. Traction Labs (Breach of Contract)**
Wang's company Traction Labs was sued for an unpaid referral fee. Wang (as CEO) claimed a check had been mailed — it never was. The case settled in March 2017 after the lie was exposed.

**2018 — Grand Theft Charge**
On November 13, 2018, Kenzi Wang was charged with **Grand Theft** in San Francisco County Superior Court, **Case No. 18017577**, under California Penal Code § 487(a). This is a felony-level theft charge. Grand Theft in California requires the value of stolen property to exceed $950.

**2018 — Sued His Own Co-Founder (Emmie Chang / Superbloom)**
Wang sued his own co-founder Emmie Chang for breach of contract in LA County Superior Court, **Case No. 18STCV05701**. Chang would later describe Wang in devastating terms to private investigators (see "Victims" section below).

**2021 — Sued by Vijay Garg (Federal Court, SDNY)**
Vijay Garg filed suit against Wang in the Southern District of New York federal court for **breach of contract, unjust enrichment, fraud in the inducement, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, and negligent misrepresentation**. Garg had invested $130,000 with Wang, who failed to deliver the promised tokens. The case was voluntarily dismissed in April 2022 — likely after a settlement — but Garg's account of Wang's behavior, given to private investigators, is damning (see below).

### The Pattern Is Always the Same

According to his victims and investigator interviews, Wang's modus operandi is consistent across every venture:

> *"Tell a big story, get you to sign an agreement, then starts exhausting your positive energy and ultimately shakes you down. Keeps doxxing you and saying 'I'm a cofounder, I have these rights, if you don't send me money I will go after you.'"* — Vijay Garg, describing Wang's playbook

> *"Sharky as fuck"* and has *"engaged in strongarm tactics in the past"* — Confidential source, private investigator report

> *"Everyone knows Kenzi is awful."* — Emmie Chang, Wang's former co-founder

When confronted, Wang deploys the same toolkit every time: threats, intimidation, doxxing, and retaliatory lawsuits. He has a Singapore-based law firm send threatening letters to anyone who pushes back. This is not speculation — it was independently reported by multiple victims across different ventures who did not know each other.

---

## A Trail of Victims: "A Whole Telegram Group of People Wronged by Kenzi Wang"

The Cere Network fraud is not an isolated incident. Private investigator reports document a **pattern of serial fraud** across multiple crypto projects and business partners. One confidential source told investigators there exists *"a whole Telegram group of people wronged by Kenzi Wang."*

### Vijay Garg / Inclusion Capital (~$10M+ in damages)

Vijay Garg, Managing Partner of Inclusion Capital (formerly Mapleblock Capital), was one of Wang's most significant victims:

- Invested $130,000 with Wang, who failed to deliver tokens
- Wang "did nothing" for their joint fund, changed passwords to lock Garg out
- Wang tried to redirect fund tokens to his personal wallet
- ~$5 million in LP money was at stake
- Garg settled for approximately $100,000 — a fraction of his losses
- Total damages estimated at ~$10 million
- Wang *"presented himself falsely"* and Garg *"trusted him blindly"*
- Has since filed separate litigation (Dubai/Middle East jurisdiction) with the support of his limited partners

Garg told investigators that Wang was fired from Huobi for "many bad reasons" — a claim that, given everything documented here, is entirely consistent with the pattern.

### Emmie Chang / Superbloom — "The Tinder Swindler of Crypto"

Emmie Chang co-founded Superbloom with Wang. Her account, given to private investigators, is perhaps the most vivid portrait of how Wang operates:

> *"[Kenzi Wang is] the white-collar crypto version of the Tinder Swindler."*

> *"Everyone knows Kenzi is awful."*

According to Chang:
- Wang was cutting deals for himself at Superbloom's expense
- Wang likely **lied about graduating from Columbia and Wharton** (educational credentials appear fabricated)
- After the relationship deteriorated, Wang sued Chang for breach of contract (Case No. 18STCV05701)

The "Tinder Swindler" comparison is apt: like the subject of that Netflix documentary, Wang builds trust, exploits relationships, extracts maximum value, then turns on his victims with legal threats when they realize what happened.

### Paralink Network
Wang misrepresented himself to the founders of Paralink Network. Details documented in private investigator reports.

### Domination Finance
Wang misrepresented himself to the Domination Finance team. After confrontation, the founders received a threatening letter from a Singapore-based law firm — Wang's standard intimidation tactic.

### Reef Finance (Denko Manceski)
Another documented victim of Wang's operations in the crypto space.

### The Common Thread

Every victim tells the same story: Wang presents himself as a connected, influential figure who can open doors. He gets access to funds, tokens, or equity. He diverts value to himself. When caught, he threatens, intimidates, and litigates. And he moves on to the next victim.

The existence of a **dedicated Telegram group for his victims** tells you everything you need to know about the scale of his operations.

## The Fund Diversion Scheme: $4.4 Million Outside Company Control

The Vivian Liu token theft (detailed below) was dramatic, but it wasn't even the largest component of Wang's fraud against Cere Network. A forensic audit by DHTY and an internal investigation by Practus LLP uncovered a systematic fund diversion scheme:

### How It Worked

Wang directed token purchasers to send payment to **wallets he personally controlled** instead of official company wallets. Over the course of Cere's funding rounds, **75+ investors** were directed to send money to Wang's personal addresses.

### The Numbers

According to the forensic audit:
- **$14,426,850** flowed through funding rounds that Wang touched
- **$4,423,400** ended up in wallets **outside company control**
- **$1,357,400** confirmed across **46 transactions** still sitting in Wang-controlled wallets at the time of discovery
- Over **$4 million from 75 investors** remained unaccounted for

### The Cover-Up

Wang maintained a separate **"Token Sale Tracker"** spreadsheet to monitor the funds he was collecting. When the company began investigating, **Wang revoked company access to this document** — destroying evidence of how much money had flowed through his personal wallets and where it went.

This is why Cere Network filed its original complaint against Wang on **May 19, 2023** in the Northern District of California — for irregular capital transfers, diversion of token-sale proceeds to personal wallets, misstatements to investors and the company, and intimidation.

## The Chandler Guo Connection: When Your Partner Owns the Exchange

**Chandler Guo** is a legendary figure in crypto:
- Co-founded Gate.io exchange
- Early Bitcoin miner and Ethereum investor
- Early investor in NEO, Binance, and Huobi
- Co-founded AU21 Capital with Kenzi Wang in 2017

[Multiple sources confirm](https://medium.com/@InsightsNetwork/insights-network-welcomes-chandler-guo-as-advisor-6981b32cb1be) this partnership and Chandler's role in Gate.io. When your business partner co-founded one of the world's major crypto exchanges, you don't just have an account there—you have insider access, preferential treatment, and most importantly, trust.

This relationship becomes crucial to understanding how the stolen tokens were laundered. Throughout this investigation, Gate.io appears repeatedly: tokens withdrawn from Gate.io, gas fees funded by Gate.io, stolen proceeds sold back to Gate.io. When you need to move millions in stolen crypto, having your business partner's exchange as your primary platform is invaluable.

## The Token Theft: 33.3 Million CERE Stolen from Vivian Liu

### Step 1: Kenzi Volunteers as the Gatekeeper (December 2021)

Internal Slack messages from December 2021 show Kenzi Wang volunteering to personally handle communications with investor Vivian Liu: *"I'll take Vivian and Jacky."* From that moment, he became the sole intermediary between Cere Network and Ms. Liu for all token-related matters.

This wasn't normal protocol. Typically, Martijn Broersma (Cere's investor relations coordinator) would collect wallet addresses directly from investors and coordinate with the operations team for distributions. But Kenzi inserted himself into this process, ensuring no one at Cere could independently verify information with Ms. Liu.

Kenzi subsequently reported back that Vivian had *"showed up, didn't sign new docs, said she got pregnant and had a baby, but wants all tokens staked."* This narrative conveniently explained away the lack of updated documentation—including why there might not be a clear wallet address from the investor.

### Step 2: A Mysterious Wallet Address Appears

Cere Network's token distribution process required investors to provide their own wallet addresses for receiving tokens. For Vivian Liu's 33,333,334 CERE allocation, this process wasn't followed.

**Critical fact: Vivian Liu confirms she never provided a Cere Network mainnet wallet address.**

**Martijn confirmed:** *"The address was never shared by the investor, already checked everything."*

Yet somehow, a wallet address appeared in Cere's internal distribution mastersheet:

**Substrate format:** [`5DZMJ4GD8MDhp2Pxsri3ysqRqoE3KfsSGE7zMgGDVngbUrwv`](https://cere.statescan.io/#/accounts/6R1GPxm3jqiRgjFXkFGLWh2XbcwZysRgXWmZjsyq43pSrwFu)
**Cere mainnet format:** [`6R1GPxm3jqiRgjFXkFGLWh2XbcwZysRgXWmZjsyq43pSrwFu`](https://cere.statescan.io/#/accounts/6R1GPxm3jqiRgjFXkFGLWh2XbcwZysRgXWmZjsyq43pSrwFu)

(These are the same address in different encoding formats—you can verify this yourself using [Polkadot's SS58 Transform Tool](https://polkadot.subscan.io/tools/ss58_transform).)

Only five people had write access to the distribution mastersheet: Andrei Kinstler (AK), Andrei (AN), Sieb, Fred, and Martijn. Through the investigation process, most were cleared. But AK and AN now appear as "deleted users" in the Google Sheet's revision history, and AK's Google Workspace data was deleted after the standard 20-day retention period.

Someone with insider access inserted a fake wallet address for Vivian Liu's distribution. The evidence points to this being done through Kenzi's influence or direct access to compromised credentials.

### Step 3: The Token Distribution (March-May 2022)

Based on the fraudulent mastersheet, Cere's operations team executed two token distributions via Fireblocks:

**March 25, 2022 - [Block 4,222,827](https://cere.statescan.io/#/extrinsics/4222827-2)**
13,333,334 CERE sent from company wallet [`6Rz7GYaWj5mY7zSFp2aNpXcPP7LkhuMr8E8g62j5mHKEYRbS`](https://cere.statescan.io/#/accounts/6Rz7GYaWj5mY7zSFp2aNpXcPP7LkhuMr8E8g62j5mHKEYRbS) to the fake investor wallet.

**May 10, 2022 - [Block 4,361,724](https://cere.statescan.io/#/extrinsics/4361724-2)**
20,000,000 CERE sent from company wallet [`6RtDT7L4rK9L7BRE78gPLEx1Dw5mvrXfhZMfPWx3bf2ib2sb`](https://cere.statescan.io/#/accounts/6RtDT7L4rK9L7BRE78gPLEx1Dw5mvrXfhZMfPWx3bf2ib2sb) to the same fake investor wallet.

**Total distributed: 33,333,334 CERE** - exactly Vivian Liu's allocation.

Evgeny Svirsky, who held co-signing authority on Fireblocks, categorically denied authorizing these transactions: *"I didn't sign anything. Nobody has my private keys."* This raises serious questions about how the distributions were authorized.

### Step 4: The Immediate Drainage

Here's where the behavior becomes unmistakably criminal.

**Within approximately 8 hours** of receiving the final token distribution, the entire balance was drained from the fake investor wallet in four carefully orchestrated transactions:

1. **2 CERE** (test transaction) → intermediary wallet [`6SCW2o71hKeWyNY2eBnti7QF2o1TG98BCuj7Fi9Fz23r6R4s`](https://cere.statescan.io/#/accounts/6SCW2o71hKeWyNY2eBnti7QF2o1TG98BCuj7Fi9Fz23r6R4s)
2. **~3,333,334 CERE** → same intermediary wallet
3. **30,000,000 CERE** → same intermediary wallet
4. **1 CERE** (dust cleanup) → same intermediary wallet

This test-then-transfer pattern is **not** investor behavior. When legitimate investors receive tokens they've been waiting months for, they don't immediately test-transfer everything to another wallet within hours. This is the behavior of someone who:

- Controls both wallets
- Is being cautious about moving large sums
- Wants to quickly consolidate the tokens elsewhere

From the intermediary wallet, all 33,333,334 CERE were then forwarded back to the original Cere company wallet [`6Rz7GYaWj5mY7zSFp2aNpXcPP7LkhuMr8E8g62j5mHKEYRbS`](https://cere.statescan.io/#/accounts/6Rz7GYaWj5mY7zSFp2aNpXcPP7LkhuMr8E8g62j5mHKEYRbS)—completing a perfect circle.

**The tokens were distributed on paper, cycled through wallets to create the appearance of a legitimate distribution, then returned to company-controlled infrastructure. Vivian Liu never received anything.**

---

## The Smoking Gun: How the Blockchain Identified Kenzi Wang

What happened next provides the forensic evidence that definitively identifies Kenzi Wang as the perpetrator. The stolen tokens were eventually bridged to Ethereum and sold through a wallet that can be conclusively linked to him.

### The Bridge Trail

From the Cere mainnet, the stolen tokens were moved through a complex bridge process:

**Cere mainnet → Polygon → Ethereum**

On January 6 and 7, 2024, the tokens emerged on Ethereum through the [Polygon (Matic): ERC20 Bridge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x40ec5b33f54e0e8a33a975908c5ba1c14e5bbbdf) and landed in wallet [`0xb08f79488D335FBc7E0881c78ba341dA1f249f00`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb08f79488D335FBc7E0881c78ba341dA1f249f00).

**January 6, 2024:** [33,333 CERE](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd8f9cbad8707da962ead135095d16dfa348f88285d90eae920997d03048f887e) (test amount)
**January 7, 2024:** [33,299,997.97 CERE](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7e4fd0db67af9dd1d080c54e188f478ff5c4d6ebdae08330adc261c2827b2ee1) (remaining balance)
**Total:** 33,333,330.97 CERE ≈ Vivian's full allocation

Again, note the test-first pattern. Someone was being very careful about moving these stolen tokens.

### The Immediate Cash-Out

Both batches of CERE were sent directly to [KuCoin exchange deposit address](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb2101f398f0c91f5f802a6a6afc56c58a4567b81) **on the same day** they were bridged:

**January 6:** [33,333 CERE → KuCoin](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcfe4dca149d7128840cf62b606b808baa560be374ea0f9ddeddf04c140c5dd4e)
**January 7:** [33,299,997.97 CERE → KuCoin](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0e2d9f4695785148052c6ccda460c29392cc87aafc2db66abb2acdacccc4cf08)

**The entire stolen allocation—33,333,330.97 CERE—was liquidated on KuCoin within 24 hours of reaching Ethereum.**

### The AU21 Capital Portfolio Fingerprint

Here's where the evidence becomes unshakeable. Three days after cashing out the stolen CERE, the same Ethereum wallet received large amounts of two very specific tokens from [Gate.io](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0d0707963952f2fba59dd06f2b425ace40b492fe):

**January 31, 2024:**
- [30,600,560.93 RAZE tokens](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5b3f8dba3138a639594014fb37ed596e95fe2af217316c84e4dd04352dc49aeb) withdrawn from Gate.io
- [5,376,609.47 SKYRIM tokens](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc110c4b5cb7565a65bd102a24e5acf1c40d807da998a4f61c9073151e381d5d6) withdrawn from Gate.io

**Why these tokens matter:**

- **[Raze Network (RAZE)](https://etherscan.io/token/0x5eaa69b29f99c84fe5de8200340b4e9b4ab38eac)**: AU21 Capital was a funding partner (April 2021)
- **[Skyrim Finance (SKYRIM)](https://etherscan.io/token/0x2610f0bfc21ef389fe4d03cfb7de9ac1e6c99d6e)**: AU21 Capital participated in Skyrim Finance's $2.1M funding round (May 2021)

These are niche DeFi projects with very limited investor bases. The fact that whoever controlled the wallet that received the stolen CERE also had massive Gate.io holdings in two AU21 Capital portfolio companies is not a coincidence.

**This is a unique digital fingerprint.** No other entity would have:
1. Access to steal Vivian Liu's CERE allocation
2. A Gate.io account with major holdings in AU21's exclusive portfolio tokens
3. The operational sophistication to execute cross-chain bridges and multi-exchange liquidation

The combination points to exactly one person: **Kenzi Wang, co-founder of AU21 Capital.**

### The Kenzi Wang Ethereum Wallet

But the evidence gets even more definitive. Through cross-referencing token holdings, investigators identified [another Ethereum wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0d0707963952f2fba59dd06f2b425ace40b492fe) that can be forensically linked to Kenzi Wang:

**Wallet:** [`0x0d0707963952f2fba59dd06f2b425ace40b492fe`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0d0707963952f2fba59dd06f2b425ace40b492fe)

**Holdings that identify the owner:**
- **276,239,956 CERE tokens** (major holder)
- **38,258,803 SKYRIM tokens** (#1 holder — 38.26% of total supply)
- **20,188,459 RAZE tokens** (#1 holder — 16.82% of total supply)

**This wallet holds the #1 position in both SKYRIM and RAZE tokens simultaneously.** Combined with massive CERE holdings, this creates a portfolio fingerprint that can only belong to Kenzi Wang through AU21 Capital.

**Most importantly, this wallet directly funded the bridge wallet** that received the stolen tokens:

- [February 1, 2024: 0.619 ETH](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x94cc11de5e5905c5efd9ba6c6a73a0881e3bf18f4a2f5278e51a41bbda5d0bdd) sent to the bridge wallet for gas fees
- [February 2, 2024: 0.214 ETH](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x58db7987b9053f8c2144a09e4ef5fc49b02ca1eebbf00e3f312c3964b025771f) sent to the bridge wallet for gas fees

**The forensic trail is complete:**
1. Kenzi's primary wallet (holding AU21 portfolio) funds the bridge wallet
2. Bridge wallet receives stolen CERE and immediately sells on KuCoin
3. Bridge wallet then receives AU21 tokens (RAZE/SKYRIM) from Gate.io
4. Everything is liquidated back through Gate.io and other exchanges

### Current Status: Active Liquidation

As of January 29, 2026, Kenzi Wang's identified wallet is **actively selling CERE tokens**. Recent transactions show consistent outflows of 200,000-2.6 million CERE every few days—a classic OTC or exchange-based liquidation pattern.

At this rate, the remaining 276 million CERE balance could be fully dissipated within months, making asset preservation urgent.

## Wang's Projection: Accusing Others of What He Did (DARVO)

One of the most telling aspects of this case is Wang's counter-narrative. After being caught diverting funds and stealing tokens, Wang filed his own derivative complaint — **Wang v. Cerebellum Network et al.** — alleging that *Fred Jin* had misappropriated company funds.

This is textbook **DARVO** — Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender. Wang accused Jin of *exactly* what the forensic evidence shows *Wang himself* was doing.

### The Internal Investigation That Destroyed Wang's Narrative

In response to Wang's allegations, an independent internal investigation was conducted by **Practus LLP** between March and July 2024. The investigation included:

- Forensic accounting analysis by DHTY
- Review of all fund flows, wallet addresses, and transaction records
- Interviews with all relevant parties, including Fred Jin and Martijn Broersma

**The conclusion was unequivocal:**

> *"No evidence to support Wang's allegations regarding Fred Jin's misappropriation of Company funds."*

Both Jin and Broersma were found credible in their interviews. The DHTY forensic report confirmed that the fund flows told the opposite story from what Wang claimed: it was **Wang** who had diverted $4.4 million+ outside company control, **Wang** who directed investors to his personal wallets, and **Wang** who revoked company access to tracking documents when the investigation began.

Wang's counter-suit isn't just meritless — it's a confession by projection. He described his own crimes and attributed them to someone else. This pattern is consistent with his behavior across every venture: when caught, attack the accuser.

---

## Social Media Hijacking: Seizing Company Assets

After his termination from Cere Network, Wang didn't go quietly. He **hijacked Cere's official Twitter account and Telegram channels**, seizing control of the company's primary communication platforms and refusing to return access despite repeated demands.

This wasn't a dispute over credentials. This was deliberate sabotage — an attempt to maintain leverage over a company that had caught him stealing. By controlling Cere's social media, Wang could:

- Prevent the company from communicating with its community
- Potentially post damaging or misleading content
- Use access as a bargaining chip in legal negotiations

The hijacking was serious enough to become a **separate criminal case in Dubai** (see Legal section below).

---

## The Cover-Up: Destroying Digital Evidence

Beyond the theft itself, there's clear evidence of systematic evidence destruction:

**Token Sale Tracker Revocation**: Wang maintained a separate "Token Sale Tracker" spreadsheet documenting investor funds he was collecting. When the company began investigating, he revoked all company access — a clear act of evidence destruction.

**Google Workspace Deletion**: Andrei Kinstler's (AK) Google Workspace data was deleted after the standard 20-day retention period, eliminating potential email and document evidence. This timing is suspicious—the deletion occurred just as the investigation might have requested access to those communications.

**"Deleted Users"**: Both AK and AN (Andrei) appear as "deleted users" in the Google Sheet's revision history, obstructing the ability to trace who made the fraudulent wallet address entries.

**Co-signer Denials**: When Evgeny Svirsky denied authorizing the Fireblocks transactions, it suggested either system compromise or manipulation of the approval workflow—both pointing to insider access.

**Isolation of the Investor**: By positioning himself as the sole contact for Vivian Liu, Kenzi ensured no one at Cere could independently verify wallet addresses or confirm her intentions. This isolation is a textbook fraud technique.

**File Removal**: Wang deleted or removed access to additional company files as the investigation closed in.

This wasn't a sloppy hack or external attack. This was a sophisticated insider operation designed to obscure the paper trail while leaving the blockchain evidence hidden in plain sight.

---

## The Legal Battlefield: Five Jurisdictions, Multiple Victims

What makes this case extraordinary isn't just the blockchain evidence—it's the complex web of litigation across multiple jurisdictions as the full scope of Kenzi Wang's crimes comes to light.

### 1. Goopal Digital Ltd. v. Jin Wang (The $100M RICO Lawsuit)

**Case:** *Goopal Digital Ltd. v. Jin Wang*, Case No. **3:26-cv-00857** (N.D. Cal.)
**Filed:** January 27, 2026
**Plaintiffs:** Vivian Liu, Goopal Digital Ltd.
**Damages Claimed:** $100 MILLION ($25M compensatory + $75M punitive)

**Defendants Named:**
- Fred Jin (CEO, Cere Network)
- Brad Bao
- Maren Schwarzer
- Xin Jin
- Martijn Broersma
- François Granade
- Cerebellum Network Inc.
- Interdata Network Ltd.
- CEF AI Inc.

**10 Causes of Action:**
1. RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act)
2. RICO Conspiracy
3. Fraud
4. Aiding & Abetting Fraud
5. Negligent Misrepresentation
6. Breach of Advisor Agreement
7. Breach of Token Sale Agreement
8. Failure to Pay Wages
9. Civil Theft (California Penal Code § 496)
10. Declaratory Relief

**The Tragic Irony:** This lawsuit was filed by **the same person whose tokens Kenzi Wang stole**. Vivian Liu is suing Cere Network for her missing 33.3 million CERE tokens, but the blockchain evidence presented in this report proves that **Kenzi Wang—not Cere—stole her allocation**. Kenzi exploited his position as an investor and advisor to steal from a fellow investor, and now that victim is suing the company instead of the actual thief.

This is exactly what Kenzi Wang wanted—to pit his victims against each other while escaping accountability for his theft.

### 2. Cere Network's Original Complaint (May 2023)

**Filed:** May 19, 2023 (N.D. Cal.)
**Plaintiff:** Interdata Network, Inc., et al.
**Defendant:** Kenzi Wang, et al.

**Claims:**
- Irregular capital transfers
- Diversion of token-sale proceeds to personal wallets
- Misstatements to investors and the company
- Intimidation and harassment

This was filed after the forensic audit revealed Wang had directed $4.4 million+ outside company control and evidence destruction was underway.

### 3. Wang v. Cerebellum Network et al. (Wang's Counter-Suit)

Wang filed his own derivative complaint, alleging Fred Jin misappropriated company funds. As documented above, the Practus LLP investigation found **zero evidence** supporting these claims and instead confirmed that Wang was the one diverting funds. This counter-suit is a textbook example of DARVO — accusing others of your own crimes.

### 4. Dubai Criminal Proceedings — TWO Cases Referred to Criminal Court

The most serious legal exposure for Wang comes from Dubai, where **two separate criminal cases** have been referred to the Criminal Court:

**Case No. 31801/2025 — Defamation**
- Public Prosecutor accepted the complaint and referred it to Criminal Court
- Hearing scheduled December 4, 2025

**Case No. 33359/2025 — Social Media Hijacking**
- Referred to **Criminal Court** (not Misdemeanor Court — indicating the prosecution considers these serious offenses warranting longer prison sentences)
- Hearing scheduled December 9, 2025
- Relates to Wang's seizure of Cere's Twitter and Telegram accounts

**Key facts:**
- Kenzi Wang was **arrested in Dubai** on Cere Network's criminal complaint
- **Released on bail after surrendering his passport** — he cannot leave the UAE
- Dubai prosecutors have indicated willingness to **appeal even if initial judgment goes against** them
- Legal assessment indicates **minimum 5-year jail exposure**

**Legal counsel:** BLK Partners (Tarek Saad, Amany Ahmed) — Dubai-based criminal defense representation

The referral to Criminal Court (rather than Misdemeanor Court) for the social media hijacking case is significant — it indicates Dubai prosecutors view Wang's conduct as serious criminal behavior, not a minor offense.

### 5. Vijay Garg / Mapleblock Capital Litigation

**Plaintiff:** Vijay Garg, Managing Partner of Mapleblock Capital (now Inclusion Capital)
**Legal Counsel:** Sameer Bindra (Khaitan & Co)
**Jurisdiction:** Dubai/Middle East
**Status:** Filed with institutional LP backing

Garg's case adds another jurisdiction and another victim to the growing legal web around Wang.

### The Legal Team

**Defending Cere Network:**
- **Rocky Lee, Esq.** — Milliard Law — lead counsel handling evidence presentation and defense strategy

**Dubai Criminal Prosecution:**
- **BLK Partners** (Tarek Saad, Amany Ahmed)

**Mapleblock/Vijay Representation:**
- **Sameer Bindra** — Khaitan & Co — handling Dubai/Middle East civil proceedings

## The Bitter Irony: Victim Sues Victim While Thief Escapes

Perhaps the most tragic aspect of this entire affair is the cruel irony at its center: **the victim of the theft is now suing another victim of the same perpetrator**.

Vivian Liu's 33.3 million CERE tokens were stolen by Kenzi Wang, who exploited his position as an investor and advisor to Cere Network. When she never received her tokens, she naturally looked to Cere Network for answers. But instead of investigating the blockchain evidence that would have revealed Kenzi as the thief, she filed a $100 million RICO lawsuit against Cere Network.

**This is exactly what Kenzi Wang wanted to happen.**

By positioning himself as the sole intermediary between Vivian and Cere, Kenzi ensured that when the theft was discovered, the two victims would blame each other instead of him. It's a classic misdirection play:

1. **Steal from the investor** (Vivian Liu)
2. **Steal from the company** (Cere Network — $4.8M in diverted funds)
3. **Let them fight each other** while you escape with the proceeds
4. **File your own lawsuit** accusing the CEO of what you did
5. **Hijack the company's social media** for additional leverage

The blockchain evidence shows that Cere Network was defrauded just as much as Vivian Liu. The company's internal processes were compromised, their Fireblocks access was misused, their distribution systems were manipulated, and $4.4 million+ in investor funds were diverted to Wang's personal wallets.

**Both Vivian Liu and Cere Network are victims of the same criminal.** Yet instead of joining forces to pursue justice against Kenzi Wang, they're spending millions in legal fees fighting each other while he continues to liquidate stolen assets.

Meanwhile, Kenzi Wang—currently on bail in Dubai after surrendering his passport—benefits from this misdirected litigation. Every day that Vivian and Cere spend fighting each other is another day he has to dissipate the 276 million CERE tokens still in his control.

**The real winner in the Goopal v. Jin Wang lawsuit is neither party named in the case title—it's Kenzi Wang.**

---

## The Gate.io Ecosystem: Where Crypto Insiders Play

Throughout this entire operation, Gate.io—co-founded by Kenzi's business partner Chandler Guo—served as the primary infrastructure:

**Withdrawals**: RAZE and SKYRIM tokens withdrawn FROM Gate.io to the bridge wallet
**Gas funding**: ETH sent FROM Gate.io to fund transaction fees
**Sales**: Stolen tokens sold back TO Gate.io
**Preferential access**: As Chandler Guo's business partner, Kenzi had insider relationships for high-volume trading

When you need to launder millions in stolen cryptocurrency, having your business partner's exchange as your primary platform provides several advantages:
- Higher withdrawal limits
- Preferential customer service
- Less scrutiny on unusual activity
- Easier coordination for large liquidations

The Gate.io connection isn't circumstantial—it's central to how the operation was executed.

## The CoinDesk Article: A Journalism Failure

Today's CoinDesk article ["Investors accuse Cere Network of $100 million fraud and token-dump scheme in lawsuit"](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/01/29/investors-accuse-cere-network-of-usd100m-fraud-and-token-dump-scheme-in-lawsuit) represents a significant failure of investigative journalism. Published January 29, 2026, the article contains numerous critical omissions that fundamentally misrepresent the situation.

### What CoinDesk Got Wrong:

**❌ No mention of Kenzi Wang stealing the tokens** — Despite blockchain evidence clearly showing the theft
**❌ No mention of the on-chain evidence** — Ignores publicly verifiable blockchain transactions
**❌ No contact with Cere Network for comment** — Violated basic journalism standards
**❌ Calls Fred Jin the "ringleader"** — Based solely on unverified plaintiff allegations; internal investigation cleared Jin completely
**❌ No mention of Kenzi Wang's Dubai arrest** — Ignored active criminal proceedings
**❌ No mention of Kenzi Wang's Grand Theft charge** — Ignored documented criminal history
**❌ No mention of the fund diversion scheme** — $4.4M+ outside company control, undisclosed
**❌ No mention of multiple ongoing lawsuits** — Presented incomplete legal picture
**❌ No mention of the pattern of serial fraud** — Multiple prior victims across years
**❌ No independent investigation** — Appears written directly from plaintiff's complaint

### The Real Journalism Story CoinDesk Missed:

- **A serial fraudster** with a criminal history going back to 2017, including Grand Theft charges
- **Active criminal prosecution** in Dubai with TWO cases in Criminal Court and passport surrender
- **Blockchain forensic evidence** identifying the actual perpetrator
- **$4.4 million diverted** from 75+ investors to personal wallets
- **An internal investigation** that completely cleared the person CoinDesk called the "ringleader"
- **Multiple victims** across different ventures, spanning nearly a decade
- **A dedicated Telegram group** of Wang's victims
- **Cross-border litigation** spanning US, Dubai, and potentially other jurisdictions
- **Exchange relationships** enabling sophisticated money laundering
- **The bitter irony** of a theft victim suing the wrong party due to the thief's manipulation

This is particularly egregious because every piece of blockchain evidence presented in this report is **publicly verifiable on blockchain explorers**. CoinDesk had access to the same transaction records, wallet addresses, and forensic evidence that definitively identifies Kenzi Wang as the perpetrator.

Instead, CoinDesk chose to publish a one-sided piece that essentially functions as a press release for the plaintiff's legal team while ignoring the actual facts of the case.

### The Dangerous Precedent

When major crypto media outlets fail to investigate blockchain evidence—the fundamental transparency feature that makes crypto different from traditional finance—they undermine the entire value proposition of the industry. The "don't trust, verify" ethos only works when journalists actually do the verification.

**The reality is that Vivian Liu's lawsuit against Cere Network is fundamentally misguided.** The tokens weren't stolen by Cere—they were stolen by Kenzi Wang, who had the access, opportunity, and insider knowledge to execute this scheme. Cere Network appears to be as much a victim of Kenzi's fraud as Vivian Liu herself.

## What Happens Next: The Legal and Financial Implications

The evidence presented here has immediate implications across multiple legal proceedings and jurisdictions:

### Immediate Legal Implications

**For the Goopal v. Jin Wang lawsuit (N.D. Cal.):**
- Vivian Liu's RICO claims against Cere Network are undermined by evidence that **Kenzi Wang stole her tokens**
- The Practus LLP investigation found **no evidence** supporting claims against Fred Jin
- Vivian Liu should amend her complaint to include Kenzi Wang as the actual defendant
- The case demonstrates classic legal misdirection—suing the victim instead of the perpetrator

**For Dubai criminal proceedings:**
- TWO cases now before Criminal Court (Cases No. 31801/2025 and 33359/2025)
- This blockchain evidence provides **forensic proof** for the criminal prosecution
- Asset preservation orders should immediately freeze the 276M CERE in Kenzi's wallet
- Exchange subpoenas (KuCoin, Gate.io, OKX, ByBit) will confirm KYC identity
- **Minimum 5-year jail exposure** now backed by irrefutable digital evidence
- Prosecutors have indicated willingness to appeal — they are pursuing this aggressively

**For Mapleblock Capital litigation:**
- Vijay's case gains strength from the forensic wallet identification
- Pattern of behavior evidence across multiple victims
- Cross-jurisdictional asset tracing becomes critical

### Asset Recovery Urgency

**276 million CERE tokens** (current value: tens of millions USD) in Kenzi Wang's identified wallet [`0x0d0707963952f2fba59dd06f2b425ace40b492fe`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0d0707963952f2fba59dd06f2b425ace40b492fe) are **actively being liquidated**:

- Recent sales: 2.6M CERE on December 30, 2025
- Pattern: 200K-2.6M CERE sold every few days
- **At current liquidation rate, the entire balance could be dissipated within months**

**Immediate action required:**
1. **Emergency asset preservation orders** in US, Dubai, and Singapore jurisdictions
2. **Exchange account freezes** at all platforms identified in this investigation
3. **Blockchain analysis services** (Chainalysis, TRM Labs) to trace all derivative wallets

### For the Crypto Industry

This case demonstrates both the **power and the paradox** of blockchain transparency:

**✅ The Power:** Every transaction is permanently recorded and publicly verifiable. No amount of corporate spin or legal maneuvering can change what happened on-chain.

**❌ The Paradox:** Despite this transparency, major media outlets (CoinDesk) still published completely inaccurate narratives without doing basic blockchain verification.

**Key Lessons:**
- **Insider threats remain the biggest risk** in crypto organizations
- **Blockchain evidence is forensically superior** to traditional financial records
- **Media verification of on-chain claims should be standard practice**
- **Cross-border enforcement** is critical for crypto crimes
- **Background checks matter** — Wang's Grand Theft charge and prior lawsuits were discoverable

### For All Parties

**Vivian Liu / Goopal Digital:** The evidence strongly suggests redirecting legal action from Cere Network to Kenzi Wang. The blockchain proves who actually took your tokens. The internal investigation cleared the people you're suing.

**Cere Network:** This investigation provides comprehensive evidence for defense against the RICO lawsuit and supports claims in their own action against Kenzi Wang.

**Law Enforcement:** Multiple jurisdictions now have forensic evidence for prosecution. Dubai authorities are furthest ahead with two criminal cases in Criminal Court and Wang's passport surrendered.

**Exchanges:** KuCoin, Gate.io, OKX, ByBit, and Binance should prepare for subpoenas and cooperate with asset recovery efforts.

**AU21 Capital:** Chandler Guo's fund faces scrutiny over its co-founder's alleged crimes and the use of Gate.io infrastructure for money laundering.

**Other Victims:** If you have been defrauded by Kenzi Wang — and the evidence suggests there are many of you — the growing legal pressure across multiple jurisdictions creates an opportunity to come forward. The "Telegram group of people wronged by Kenzi Wang" is evidence that you are not alone.

### The Words of His Victims

> *"The white-collar crypto version of the Tinder Swindler."* — Emmie Chang, Wang's former co-founder

> *"Everyone knows Kenzi is awful."* — Emmie Chang

> *"Sharky as fuck"* — Confidential source

> *"Tell a big story, get you to sign an agreement, then starts exhausting your positive energy and ultimately shakes you down."* — Vijay Garg

> *"A whole Telegram group of people wronged by Kenzi Wang."* — Confidential source

### The Bottom Line

**Kenzi Wang is a serial fraudster.** This is not opinion — it is the conclusion supported by court records, forensic audits, blockchain evidence, internal investigations, and the testimony of multiple independent victims spanning nearly a decade.

**He stole Vivian Liu's tokens.** The blockchain evidence is definitive, forensic, and publicly verifiable.

**He diverted $4.4 million+ from 75+ investors.** The forensic audit traced the funds to his personal wallets.

**He has a criminal record.** Grand Theft charge (2018), bad-faith arbitration (2017), multiple lawsuits for fraud.

**An independent investigation cleared Fred Jin.** The person CoinDesk called the "ringleader" was exonerated. Wang was identified as the perpetrator.

**He accused others of his own crimes.** Classic DARVO — and the investigation proved it.

**He is currently facing criminal prosecution in Dubai.** Two cases in Criminal Court, passport surrendered, minimum 5-year jail exposure.

**He has defrauded so many people** that his victims have a Telegram group.

The pattern is clear. The evidence is permanent. The identification is forensically sound. The question is no longer "what happened?"—the blockchain has answered that definitively.

**The question is: will the legal system act on this evidence before the stolen assets are completely dissipated?**

## The Path Forward: Justice Through Transparency

This investigation demonstrates the revolutionary potential of blockchain technology for combating financial crime. For the first time in history, we have a financial system where every transaction is permanently recorded in an immutable public ledger that anyone can examine.

Traditional financial crimes rely on destroying evidence—shredding documents, wiping hard drives, claiming records were "lost." Kenzi Wang tried all of these tactics: revoking access to spreadsheets, deleting files, eliminating Google Workspace data. But blockchain crimes leave permanent evidence that no one can delete, alter, or hide.

### What This Means for Accountability

**For Kenzi Wang:** The evidence is conclusive and growing stronger. With two active criminal prosecutions in Dubai, civil litigation in multiple US jurisdictions, and 276 million CERE tokens being actively traced, legal accountability appears inevitable. His criminal history — stretching back to 2017 — establishes a pattern that no jury or judge will ignore.

**For Gate.io and Chandler Guo:** Serious questions about how AU21 Capital's co-founder was able to use Gate.io infrastructure to launder stolen tokens. Exchange compliance and anti-money laundering procedures need scrutiny.

**For the Crypto Industry:** This case should become a teaching example of how blockchain forensics can identify even sophisticated inside operations — and why background checks on insiders matter. Wang's Grand Theft charge was a matter of public record.

**For Victims:** If you've been defrauded by Kenzi Wang, you are not alone. The evidence is mounting, the legal pressure is building across jurisdictions, and the blockchain ensures that evidence cannot be destroyed. The Telegram group of victims suggests many more stories remain untold.

### Final Words: The Blockchain Remembers

In an industry where "code is law" and "don't trust, verify" are foundational principles, this investigation puts those values into practice. We don't ask anyone to trust our conclusions—we provide the blockchain evidence, court case numbers, and source documentation for independent verification.

Kenzi Wang may have thought that by manipulating corporate processes, exploiting personal relationships, destroying evidence, hijacking social media accounts, filing retaliatory lawsuits, and intimidating anyone who challenged him, he could steal millions and escape accountability.

He was wrong.

**The blockchain remembers everything. The blockchain reveals everything. The blockchain never forgets.**

As his own former co-founder said: *"Everyone knows Kenzi is awful."*

Now, everyone will know exactly *how* awful — and the evidence is written permanently in code that no one can erase.
