### Claimed Education (UNVERIFIED, CONTRADICTORY)

| Platform | Columbia Major Claimed | Wharton MBA |
|----------|----------------------|-------------|
| Wikitia (2025, paid page) | **Computer Science** | Yes |
| Everipedia (2021) | **Mathematics, Finance, and Financial Management Services** | Yes |
| Signal NFX | **Mathematics** | Yes |

### Claimed Career vs. Reality

| Claimed | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "CEO of hadron.cloud" | **Cliff Szu** was the actual CEO (LinkedIn, CryptoBriefing, Reddit all confirm) |
| "VP and General Manager at Huobi Global" (5-year tenure) | 2017-2019 only (3 years); HBUS ceased operations Dec 2019 under his watch |
| "CEO and Co-founder of Traction Labs" | Forbes 2014: described as "growth engineer" by co-founder Tiffany Pham, not CEO |
| "Three rounds from NEA and Lightbank" | Real investors: China Rock Capital, Telegraph Hill Capital, 500 Startups, Digital Garage, Ullas Naik — ZERO NEA/Lightbank evidence |
| "Traction Labs successfully acquired in 2017" | No acquirer named; TechCrunch URL is 404; Reddit (Dec 2017) asks "Why did Traction fail?" |
| "General Partner at a16z crypto" | Per CypherHunter — **completely fabricated**; not listed on a16z's team |
| "Supported Tesla, SpaceX, Perplexity, Apptronik" | Only appears on fabricated Wikitia page; no database confirms |

# 4. THE CERE NETWORK FRAUD

### 4.1 Fund Diversion Scheme ($4.4M+)

Wang directed **75+ token purchasers** to send payment to wallets he personally controlled instead of official Cere company wallets.

| Amount | Description | Date |
|--------|-------------|------|
| $2,671,400 USDC | Private funds in Kenzi's Binance custody ("black swan" admission) | Jan 19, 2021 |
| $320,000 USDC | Additional funds raised, part of "black swan" | Jan 27, 2021 |
| $1,382,000 USDC | Funds in unapproved wallets | Apr 8, 2023 |
| $444,500 USDC | Shadow admin gap | May 9, 2023 |
| **$4,817,900** | **Total direct theft** | |

Wang maintained a separate "Token Sale Tracker" spreadsheet. When investigation began, he **revoked company access** — destroying evidence.

### 4.2 Vivian Liu Token Theft (33.3M CERE)

**Step 1:** Dec 2021 — Kenzi volunteered as sole contact for investor Vivian Liu ("I'll take Vivian and Jacky")

**Step 2:** A wallet address appeared in Cere's distribution sheet that **Vivian Liu never provided**:
- Substrate: `5DZMJ4GD8MDhp2Pxsri3ysqRqoE3KfsSGE7zMgGDVngbUrwv`
- Cere mainnet: `6R1GPxm3jqiRgjFXkFGLWh2XbcwZysRgXWmZjsyq43pSrwFu`

**Step 3:** Tokens distributed from company wallets:
- Mar 25, 2022: 13,333,334 CERE — [Block 4,222,827](https://cere.statescan.io/#/extrinsics/4222827-2)
- May 10, 2022: 20,000,000 CERE — [Block 4,361,724](https://cere.statescan.io/#/extrinsics/4361724-2)

**Step 4:** Within ~8 hours, all tokens drained via test-then-transfer pattern to intermediary wallet `6SCW2o71hKeWyNY2eBnti7QF2o1TG98BCuj7Fi9Fz23r6R4s`, then returned to Cere company wallet — creating appearance of legitimate distribution while Vivian received nothing.

### 4.3 The Blockchain Smoking Gun

**Bridge to Ethereum (Jan 6-7, 2024):**
- [33,333 CERE](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd8f9cbad8707da962ead135095d16dfa348f88285d90eae920997d03048f887e) (test) → Bridge wallet `0xb08f79488D335FBc7E0881c78ba341dA1f249f00`
- [33,299,997.97 CERE](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7e4fd0db67af9dd1d080c54e188f478ff5c4d6ebdae08330adc261c2827b2ee1) (remainder) → Same wallet

**Immediate KuCoin liquidation (same day):**
- [33,333 CERE → KuCoin](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcfe4dca149d7128840cf62b606b808baa560be374ea0f9ddeddf04c140c5dd4e)
- [33,299,997.97 CERE → KuCoin](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0e2d9f4695785148052c6ccda460c29392cc87aafc2db66abb2acdacccc4cf08)

**AU21 Capital portfolio fingerprint (Jan 31, 2024):**
Same bridge wallet received from Gate.io:
- [30,600,560.93 RAZE tokens](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5b3f8dba3138a639594014fb37ed596e95fe2af217316c84e4dd04352dc49aeb)
- [5,376,609.47 SKYRIM tokens](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc110c4b5cb7565a65bd102a24e5acf1c40d807da998a4f61c9073151e381d5d6)

Both RAZE and SKYRIM are AU21 Capital portfolio companies — creating a unique fingerprint that can only belong to Kenzi Wang.

**Gas funding from Gate.io hot wallet (labeled "Gate.io 1"):**
- [Feb 1, 2024: 0.619 ETH](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x94cc11de5e5905c5efd9ba6c6a73a0881e3bf18f4a2f5278e51a41bbda5d0bdd)
- [Feb 2, 2024: 0.214 ETH](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x58db7987b9053f8c2144a09e4ef5fc49b02ca1eebbf00e3f312c3964b025771f)

**Additional exchange deposits from bridge wallet:**
- [Feb 24, 2024: 0.1737 ETH → OKX](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xad30ac750316d48fba13512dd71c0efaefdb3eb333da0e978d476f5b8bffdd2f)
- [Jul 7, 2024: 0.00027 ETH → ByBit](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcb9c67fd15a2cbb5faa223c79d3b431e7e9ecef7e4d4b2f32cd91f84d86bb66f)

**Bridge wallet is now empty:** Balance $0.04 as of Feb 2026. All proceeds extracted.

**Important forensic note (from Round 2):** Wallet `0x0d0707963952f2fba59dd06f2b425ace40b492fe` is labeled on Etherscan as "**Gate.io 1**" — a Gate.io exchange hot wallet, not a personal wallet. This means the CERE/RAZE/SKYRIM holdings are exchange-custodied. Gate.io subpoena would identify which account made the specific withdrawals.

### 4.4 Social Media Hijacking & Evidence Destruction

After termination, Kenzi:
- **Hijacked Cere's official Twitter and Telegram** — seized control, refused to return access
- **Revoked company access** to Token Sale Tracker
- **Deleted or removed** additional company files
- **AK's Google Workspace data** was deleted after 20-day retention period

### 4.5 The DARVO Counter-Narrative

Kenzi filed his own lawsuit (Wang v. Cerebellum, Delaware Chancery) claiming **$58 million** was diverted — accusing Fred Jin of exactly what he himself did. The Practus LLP investigation (Mar-Jul 2024) found **zero evidence** supporting Wang's claims and identified Wang as the perpetrator.

# 5. PATTERN OF SERIAL FRAUD

### 5.1 Modus Operandi (Consistent Across Every Venture)

As described by multiple independent victims:

> *"Tell a big story, get you to sign an agreement, then starts exhausting your positive energy and ultimately shakes you down. Keeps doxxing you and saying 'I'm a cofounder, I have these rights, if you don't send me money I will go after you.'"* — **Vijay Garg**

> *"[Kenzi Wang is] the white-collar crypto version of the Tinder Swindler."* — **Emmie Chang**, co-founder of SuperBloom

> *"Sharky as fuck"* and has *"engaged in strongarm tactics in the past"* — **Confidential source**

> *"Everyone knows Kenzi is awful."* — **Emmie Chang**

**The pattern:** Present as well-connected insider → gain access to funds/tokens/equity → divert value to himself → when caught, threaten/intimidate/litigate → move to next venture

### 5.2 Documented Victims

| Victim | Venture | Damage | Year |
|--------|---------|--------|------|
| **Vivian Liu** | Cere Network | 33.3M CERE stolen | 2022-2024 |
| **75+ investors** | Cere Network | $4.4M+ diverted | 2021-2023 |
| **Vijay Garg / Inclusion Capital** | AU21 / shared fund | ~$10M+ estimated | 2021 |
| **Emmie Chang** | SuperBloom | Undisclosed | 2018 |
| **Traction Corporation** | Domain squatting | Legal costs (7 domains) | 2017 |
| **Stafftopia/ERG** | Traction Labs | Unpaid referral fee | 2017 |
| **Paralink Network founders** | Misrepresentation | Undisclosed | Per PI report |
| **Domination Finance founders** | Misrepresentation | Threatening letters | Per PI report |
| **Reef Finance (Denko Mancheski)** | AU21 operations | Undisclosed | Per PI report |
| **Retail investors (Republic)** | Cere Network | CERE dropped 99%+ | 2021 |
| **$ELE token holders** | Polygon meme coin | $17M→$2M market cap | 2024 |
| **Wanaka Farm investors** | Advisory project | WANA down 99%+ | 2022 |
| **Dragon Kart investors** | Advisory project | KART down 99.1% | 2022 |
| **SuperBloom SEED holders** | ICO | BitcoinTalk scam warning | 2018 |

**A whole Telegram group of people wronged by Kenzi Wang exists** — per confidential source in PI report.

### 5.3 Dead Projects Kenzi Advised/Founded

| Project | Kenzi's Role | Token Price / Status |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| Buzzstarter/Traction Labs | CEO/Co-founder | Marketplace vanished by 2015; no acquisition found |
| SuperBloom (SEED) | Co-founder | Dead — BitcoinTalk scam warning |
| Cere Network (CERE) | Co-founder | $0.0012 (99%+ from $0.45 launch) |
| HBUS (Huobi US) | VP/GM | Ceased operations Dec 15, 2019 |
| Wanaka Farm (WANA) | Strategic Advisor | $0.001715 — effectively dead |
| Dragon Kart (KART) | Advisor (via AU21) | $0.00455 ($0 trading volume) — dead |
| Bitlearn (BLB) | Advisory Board | Appears dead/inactive |
| $ELE (Elecoin) | Organizer | Crashed from $17M to $2M |
| hadron.cloud | Claims "CEO" (false) | Rebranded to Multiverse.ai |

# 6. FABRICATED CREDENTIALS & PR CAMPAIGN

### 6.1 The Paid Wikitia Page (July 2025)

The Kenzi Wang Wikitia page was **created by "Ankush.srg"** — a professional paid Wikitia page creation service — on **July 31, 2025** (6 months before the lawsuits). It contains **5+ fabricated citations**:

| # | Claimed Reference | Status |
|---|-------------------|--------|
| 1 | `techcrunch.com/2017/03/10/traction-labs-acquired/` | **404 Not Found** |
| 2 | `techcrunch.com/2022/08/17/symbolic-capital-launch-kenzi-wang/` | **404 Not Found** |
| 3 | `businessinsider.com/kenzi-wang-investments-startups-ai-symbolic-2023-11` | **404 Not Found** |

| 5 | `forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2018/01/15/huobi-expands-us-market/` | **403/Not accessible** |

The page also claims Wang "supported notable startups, including **Tesla, SpaceX, Perplexity, and Apptronik**" — claims that appear nowhere else and are not supported by any investment database.

**Sources:** Wikitia (https://wikitia.com/wiki/Kenzi_Wang), Edit history (https://wikitia.com/w/index.php?title=Kenzi_Wang&action=history), Ankush.srg service (https://page.wikitia.com/)

### 6.2 Fabricated NEA/Lightbank Investment Claims

Kenzi repeatedly claims Traction Labs raised from "NEA and Lightbank." Contemporary sources reveal the actual investors:

| Source (Year) | Actual Investors Listed |
|--------------|----------------------|
| **TechCrunch (2014)** | Digital Garage, 500 Startups, Ullas Naik |
| **AdExchanger (2015)** | China Rock Capital, Telegraph Hill Capital, 500 Startups |

**NEA and Lightbank appear in ZERO contemporary sources.** They only appear in bios Kenzi wrote himself years later.

**Sources:** TechCrunch (https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/19/traction-launch/), AdExchanger (https://www.adexchanger.com/platforms/buzzstarter-grabs-attention-for-organic-content-with-paid-distribution/)

### 6.3 Fabricated Traction Labs "Acquisition"

- Wikitia claims "successfully acquired in 2017"
- No acquirer has **ever** been named
- The Wikitia reference URL (`techcrunch.com/2017/03/10/traction-labs-acquired/`) returns **404 Not Found**
- Reddit r/PPC (Dec 2017): "Why did Traction fail?" — marketplace vanished by end of 2015
- Tracxn: "Traction Labs has made no investments or acquisitions yet"

**Sources:** Fabricated URL (404), Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/7mi7s3/why_did_traction_fail/), Tracxn (https://tracxn.com/d/companies/traction-labs/__lrZwGRyuLPpebivd3nEnxSDjI5aQJYWoCSk7YaaZJFQ)

### 6.4 Fabricated hadron.cloud CEO Title

The Org lists Kenzi as "CEO of hadron.cloud." Multiple sources confirm the actual CEO was **Cliff Szu**:
- LinkedIn (Mar 2018): "Cliff Szu: Cliff is an entrepreneur and the CEO of Hadron"
- CryptoBriefing: "Cliff Szu: former CEO and Co-founder"
- Reddit (Jan 2018): Describes "Cliff" presenting at live demo as CEO

**Sources:** LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hadroncloud-ai-revolution-mined-your-phone-computers-web-kading), CryptoBriefing (https://cryptobriefing.com/hadron-ico-review-decentralized-ai-marketplace/)

### 6.5 Fabricated a16z Crypto Title

CypherHunter lists Kenzi as "General Partner at a16z crypto" — Kenzi is NOT a GP at Andreessen Horowitz's crypto fund. a16z's team is publicly listed; Kenzi is not among them.

**Source:** CypherHunter (https://www.cypherhunter.com/en/p/kenzi-wang/)

### 6.6 Title Inflation Pattern

| Context | Title Claimed |
|---------|-------------|
| Forbes 2014 (by co-founder Tiffany Pham) | "**Growth engineer**" |
| All later profiles | "**CEO and Co-founder**" |
| The Org (Kambria) | "**Director of Growth**" at Huobi |
| All other profiles | "**Vice President & General Manager**" at Huobi |
| Wikitia | "**Five-year tenure**" at Huobi (2017-2020 = 3 years) |

### 6.7 Web of Self-Promotion Domains

Kenzi maintains an extensive SEO/reputation management web:
- **0xkenzi.com** — personal brand site
- **kenziwang.com** — Substack redirect, "Ecosystem Advisor at Polygon"
- **kenziwang.xyz** — investment portfolio site
- **kenziwang.org** — scholarship targeting minors ages 15-19
- **kenziwang.substack.com** — blog posts about AI

# 7. THE $ELE MEME COIN SCANDAL

In May 2024, crypto community member Rahul Ghangas (@Rahul__Ghangas) published a detailed exposé alleging a Polygon insider pump-and-dump scheme using $ELE (Elecoin).

### Named Participants
1. **Kenzi Wang** — Partner at Symbolic Capital, Polygon advisor — **authorized domain access** for project website
2. **Jack Lu** — Co-founder of Multibit/BounceBit, NGC Ventures partner
3. **Sanket Shah** — Head of Strategy at Polygon Labs
4. **Sachi Kamiya** — Polygon Ventures founding team, Symbolic venture partner, **Kenzi's romantic partner**
5. **Jiayi Li** — GP at GeekCartel, co-founder of Salus Security

### How It Worked
- Token generation event in December 2023, most supply controlled by insiders
- January 3, 2024: KOLs gathered in Telegram group to promote $ELE
- Developers and KOLs promised USDC compensation but **never paid**
- Insiders continuously sold while promoters hyped the token
- Market cap crashed from **$17 million to $2 million**
- Premise: Polygon's Sandeep Nailwal "has a pet elephant" — actually a rescued elephant he made a small donation to
- After collapse, Kenzi **"still had the courage to propose raising funds for the meme coin fund"**

### ZachXBT Confirmation
ZachXBT (crypto's most respected fraud investigator) publicly called out Kenzi in January 2022 (tweet: https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1483577541587783690) for "threatening and abusing founders" — per multiple independent references in the $ELE coverage.

- **Polygon Ventures** — Founding team member
- **Symbolic Capital** — Part-time venture partner
- **Sentient** — Director of Business Operations

### 8.2 Symbolic Capital Investing in Their Own Project (Sentient)

Sentient's $85M seed round investors include **Symbolic Capital** (Kenzi's fund). Simultaneously:
- Kenzi is a "core contributor" to Sentient (via Sensys)

### 8.3 The AU21-Gate.io Pipeline

Kenzi's AU21 co-founder Chandler Guo co-founded Gate.io. Throughout the Cere fraud:
- Stolen tokens and portfolio tokens withdrawn FROM Gate.io
- Gas fees funded BY Gate.io
- Stolen proceeds potentially sold back TO Gate.io
- Kenzi had insider access and preferential treatment at Gate.io

### 8.4 The Alexi Nedeltchev Inner Circle

Alexi Nedeltchev (Buzzstarter co-founder/CTO) followed Kenzi through:
1. **Buzzstarter** → Co-founder and CTO
2. **AU21 Capital** → Partner
3. **$21M Polygon Ecosystem Fund** → Fund manager at AU21

This inner circle loyalty enabled the creation of interconnected entities.

# 9. CURRENT EXPOSURE

### 9.1 Sentient AI ($85M at Risk)

Kenzi Wang is a "core contributor" to Sentient via his startup **Sensys**. Sentient raised $85M in seed funding co-led by:
- **Peter Thiel's Founders Fund**
- **Pantera Capital**
- **Framework Ventures**
- Also: Ethereal Ventures, Robot Ventures, **Symbolic Capital** (Kenzi's fund), Delphi Ventures, Hack VC, Arrington Capital

**The question:** Do Founders Fund, Pantera, and other investors know that a core contributor has:
- A Grand Theft charge (2018)
- Two criminal cases in Dubai Criminal Court
- Was arrested in Dubai and surrendered his passport
- Is defendant in multiple federal lawsuits
- Has a documented pattern of serial fraud going back to 2017
- ZachXBT called him out for threatening project founders

### 9.2 Symbolic Capital ($50M Fund)

Kenzi co-founded Symbolic Capital with Sandeep Nailwal, raising $50M in August 2022 — **in the same period** that evidence was being gathered about his $4.4M+ diversion from Cere Network. No media outlet mentioned his criminal record at the time.

Coverage that failed to note any red flags:
- TechCrunch (Aug 25, 2022)
- CoinDesk (Aug 25, 2022)
- Decrypt (Aug 25, 2022)
- The Block (Aug 25, 2022)
- Forbes India

### 9.3 Kenzi Wang Scholarship (Targeting Minors)

Kenzi operates a scholarship (kenziwang.org) offering $10,000 grants to teenagers aged 15-19, with:
- Monthly mentorship office hours and private Discord
- **Follow-on capital up to $250,000 from Symbolic Capital**
- Targeting "immigrant, first-gen, refugee, or simply resource-constrained" youth

A person with a Grand Theft charge, Dubai arrest, and documented serial fraud is **targeting minors** for recruitment, funneling them into his investment pipeline.

**Source:** kenziwang.org (https://www.kenziwang.org/, https://www.kenziwang.org/mission)

### 9.4 Active Token Liquidation

As of January 2026, Kenzi's identified wallets show **active selling of CERE tokens** — 200K-2.6M CERE every few days. The bridge wallet has been fully drained. The main wallet `0x0d0707...` (Gate.io) held 276M CERE as of the original report — requiring Gate.io subpoena to confirm current status.

# CONCLUSION

The evidence against Kenzi Wang is **overwhelming, multi-sourced, and independently verifiable**. It comes from:

- ✅ **Public blockchain data** — immutable, verifiable by anyone
- ✅ **Federal court records** — PACER/CourtListener, 4+ active cases
- ✅ **Dubai criminal proceedings** — 2 cases in Criminal Court, passport surrendered
- ✅ **Forensic audit reports** (DHTY) — tracing $4.8M in diversions
- ✅ **Internal investigation** (Practus LLP) — cleared Fred Jin, identified Wang
- ✅ **Private investigator reports** — documenting victims and criminal history
- ✅ **ZachXBT** — crypto's top fraud investigator publicly flagged Kenzi
- ✅ **Multiple independent victims** — across different ventures, spanning 9 years
- ✅ **Fabricated credentials** — 5+ fake citations, fake acquisition, fake CEO title, fake investors
- ✅ **The words of his own victims** — "The white-collar crypto version of the Tinder Swindler"

**Kenzi Wang is a serial fraudster** who has spent nearly a decade defrauding business partners, investors, and companies across the crypto industry. The blockchain evidence is permanent. The court records are public. The pattern is undeniable.

**The most urgent question: Will the $85 million in Sentient investor capital be protected before Kenzi finds new ways to extract value?**
