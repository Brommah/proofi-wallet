## REBUTTAL: "Fred stole $41M+ by selling tokens" → Managed Token Sale Program for Investors

### The Claim (Kenzi's narrative, repeated in Goopal complaint)
Kenzi Wang and the Goopal complaint allege that Fred Jin "secretly sold over $41 million in Cere Tokens" and "siphoned about $16.6 million in investor funds." This is categorically false.

### The Truth: Investor-Elected Market Maker Distribution Program

On November 9, 2021 — the day of Cere's token listing — Cere sent a mass email to ALL private sale investors from investors@cere.network titled "Cere Network private sale update." This email presented two options:

**Option A:** "I prefer that Cere Tokens will be distributed to me within 30 days conform initial vesting schedule" — direct token distribution

**Option B:** Market making exit — have Cere sell the investor's allocated tokens through a market maker and receive USDC proceeds, capped at 2x the investor's original principal investment

The rationale was explicitly stated: "Our primary exchange partner has urgently requested us to suggest a slightly different distribution scheme of private sale purchasers for the reason of facilitating a healthy token listing for all participants."

This is standard practice in crypto: instead of having all private investors dump tokens simultaneously at listing (causing a price crash), a market maker sells gradually, and proceeds are distributed to investors in stablecoins.

### Evidence: Investor Responses Confirming Opt-In

Multiple investors responded to the Nov 9, 2021 email confirming their election:

1. **Jialu (LD Capital):** "We've submitted the form and selected the market-making option." (Nov 9, 2021)

2. **Ivan Chong:** "I have choose 'I prefer that Cere Tokens will be distributed to me within 30 days conform initial vesting schedule' for my 2 SAFT." (Nov 9, 2021) — showing BOTH options existed and investors chose freely

3. **Heather Harde (Arrington Capital):** "Our auditors have asked for the additional follow up communication to our private sale Option B election to allow the market making exit of our Cere tokens. We actively elected Option B." (Jun 17, 2022) — Arrington's own auditors confirmed the election

### Evidence: USDC Distribution Back to Investors (with on-chain proof)

The proceeds from the market maker token sales were distributed BACK to the investors who elected Option B:

1. **Arrington Capital ($500,000)**
   - Martijn Broersma to Heather Harde (Jun 17, 2022): "We have sold your tokens through our market maker at an average price of $0.142/CERE, up to the maximum of 2x your principal. In November, we transferred $500,000 (2x $250,000 principal) to your wallet."
   - On-chain proof: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcf995ea48a4abd97b22ee77e75d5c6e5c86cfa04126ed52a2a2fc999b4ac7c18

2. **Bernard Desarnauts ($20,000)**
   - Martijn Broersma from investors@cere.network (May 20, 2022): "Could you confirm the following wallet address to receive the $20K USDC for the Cere tokens we have sold on your behalf through our market maker?"
   - Fred Jin confirmed transfer: "20,000 USDC was sent to your wallet"
   - On-chain proof: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0e7451978349705403267ef31ccc7d71830f50b93e254459e1b6bae3eec26f75

3. **Woodstock Fund ($100,000)**
   - Divesh Agrawal (Woodstock) confirmed the arrangement in email (May 12, 2022): "Bumping this up again to check on status of 100k USDT worth of tokens that you guys sold on our behalf."
   - Pranav Sharma (Woodstock): "Looking forward to close this from accounting standpoint."
   - Martijn forwarded to Fred with cell link to the master distribution spreadsheet
   - Test transfer: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x908c4772fdabb1e0542abf731dd5dbe55f8626e719fd7dc4c454a480e9d0a736

4. **Bixin Capital / Xi Wang ($200,000)**
   - Xi Wang confirmed wallet address for "$200,000 USDT" distribution
   - Martijn forwarded to Fred: "Total amount to be transferred is $200K, and is the last outstanding MM transfer from the mastersheet"
   - This was tracked in a Google Sheets mastersheet with cell-level references

### Key Facts That Destroy the "Theft" Narrative

1. **Investors CHOSE this:** The market maker selling was an opt-in program. Investors were presented with two options and made their election via a form. Multiple investors confirmed their choices in writing.

2. **Proceeds went to INVESTORS, not to Fred or insiders:** Every dollar from the market maker token sales was distributed back to the investors who opted in. On-chain transactions prove this.

3. **Capped at 2x principal:** The program was capped at 2x the investor's original investment. This is a standard investor protection mechanism — investors were guaranteed up to 2x their money back in stables, regardless of token price movements.

4. **Fully tracked and documented:** A Google Sheets mastersheet tracked every distribution, with cell-level references for each investor. Email papertrails exist for each transfer.

5. **Arrington Capital's AUDITORS confirmed it:** Heather Harde (Arrington) explicitly said their auditors requested documentation of the "Option B election" — meaning a major institutional investor's auditing firm recognized this as a legitimate, auditable transaction.

6. **Average price was $0.142/CERE:** This was above the private sale price, meaning investors actually profited from the arrangement. This is the opposite of a fraud scheme.

7. **Standard industry practice:** The email explicitly states the exchange partner requested this "for the reason of facilitating a healthy token listing for all participants." This is how virtually every major token launch works — controlled distribution to prevent a dump.

### How This Connects to the "$41M" Claim

The "$41M" figure that Kenzi cites as "theft" is actually the total value of tokens sold through the market maker — ON BEHALF OF investors who elected Option B. The money flowed:

Investors elected Option B → Market maker sold tokens → USDC proceeds → distributed back to those same investors

This was not "Fred selling tokens for himself." This was a professionally managed distribution service where Cere acted as a custodial intermediary between investors and the market maker.

## REBUTTAL: Gotbit / Market Making Arrangement (Allegation 85)

### The Claim
The Goopal complaint alleges the Gotbit arrangement was "negotiated by Broersma and Jin" (Allegation 85).

### The Truth
Telegram group screenshots from BOTH "Cere x Gotbit" groups prove Martijn Broersma had NO involvement:

**"Cere x Gotbit" (original group):**
- Kenzi Wang was the coordinator — set up Gate sub-accounts, provided listing price ($0.035), delivered company details (Interdata Network Inc, BVI)
- Kenzi asked "can you also mm for bitcoin.com"
- Grant Sukhanov (Gotbit) discussed strategy with Kenzi
- Mart is mentioned once by Kavi but has ZERO messages in the entire chat

**"Cere x Gotbit NEW" (new group, 19 members):**
- April 24, 2022: Alex Andryunin (Gotbit owner) opens with KuCoin CERE chart
- April 26-27: Alex to Fred: "bro are you around? you asked me to fix this situation on your market, we are ready"
- May 15: Fred responds: "apologies for finding this chat just now" and schedules a call
- May 17: Call takes place between Fred and Gotbit team (Google Meet, CERE x GOTBIT)
- May 17-20: Gotbit sends proposals ("Cere Network by Gotbit.pdf", "Cere Proposal.pdf") requesting 400K USDT minimum
- Kavi asks Fred to set up KuCoin accounts (MM1, MM2, MM3 sub-accounts, API keys)
- Mart appears NOWHERE in this group — no messages, not on the call, not in any planning

### Key Point
Market making is a standard, legal practice for token projects. The Gotbit relationship was managed by others, not by Mart. Allegation 85's claim that Mart "negotiated" this is factually false — as proven by the complete chat records of both Gotbit groups.

## Additional Counter-Claims: Kenzi Wang's Documented Fraud Pattern

### 1. Vivian Liu Token Theft (33.3M CERE)
- Dec 23, 2021: Kenzi volunteered in Slack as sole contact for Vivian Liu
- Fake wallet address inserted by "deleted user" in Google Sheets mastersheet
- Mar 25, 2022: 13.3M CERE sent to fake wallet (Block 4,361,724)
- May 10, 2022: 20M CERE sent to same fake wallet (Block 5,019,196)
- Jan 6-7, 2024: Tokens bridged Cere→Polygon→Ethereum and sold on KuCoin within hours
- Bridge wallet (0xb08f...) also received RAZE and SKYRIM tokens (AU21 Capital portfolio companies = Kenzi's fund)
- Bridge wallet now fully drained ($0.04 balance)

### 2. Fund Diversions ($4.8M confirmed)
- $2,671,400 USDC — Private funds held in Kenzi's Binance custody
- $320,000 USDC — "Black swan" admission
- $1,382,000 USDC — Funds in unapproved wallets
- $444,500 USDC — Shadow admin gap
- 75+ token purchasers directed to wallets Kenzi personally controlled
- Kenzi maintained separate "Token Sale Tracker" then revoked company access

### 3. Criminal History
- Grand Theft charge (2018, SF County Superior Court, Case No. 18017577)
- Arrested in Dubai, passport surrendered, active travel ban
- Two criminal cases in Dubai Criminal Court (31801/2025 & 33359/2025)
- Hearing scheduled February 26, 2026

### 4. $ELE Pump-and-Dump (May 2024)
- Kenzi authorized domain access for project website
- Insiders controlled most supply
- Market cap crashed from $17M to $2M as insiders dumped
- ZachXBT publicly flagged Kenzi for "threatening and abusing founders"

### 5. DARVO Pattern
Kenzi filed his own $58M derivative complaint in Delaware Chancery (Wang v. Cerebellum Network) accusing Fred of exactly what Kenzi himself did. Then directed Vivian Liu to sue Cere — creating a two-front legal war while Kenzi liquidated stolen assets.

The Practus LLP independent investigation (March-July 2024) and DHTY forensic audit concluded: "No evidence to support Wang's allegations regarding Fred Jin's misappropriation of Company funds." Both Fred and Mart were found credible in their interviews.
