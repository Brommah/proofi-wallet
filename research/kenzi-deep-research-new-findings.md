# Kenzi Wang — Deep Research: NEW Findings
## Compiled: February 1, 2026

---

## 1. 🔥 $100M RICO LAWSUIT AGAINST CERE NETWORK (January 2026)
**Confidence: HIGH**

A **$100 million federal lawsuit** was filed in U.S. federal court on January 27, 2026, against Cere Network (Cerebellum Networks) and its founder Fred Jin. The lawsuit alleges **fraud, racketeering (RICO), and large-scale token dumping** following Cere's 2021 ICO.

Key allegations:
- Insiders **secretly sold over $41 million in Cere tokens** on various exchanges
- Misappropriated investor funds
- CERE fell from ~$0.45 at launch to $0.06 within weeks, currently at **$0.0012 — a 99%+ drop**
- Plaintiff Lujunjin "Vivian" Liu and Goopal Digital Ltd. are seeking $25M in compensatory damages and $75M in punitive damages
- Cere **overstated customer traction, technical readiness, and enterprise adoption**, including claims about Fortune 1000 clients

**Critically:** In a **separate Delaware Court of Chancery lawsuit** filed ~2 weeks prior, **"Cerebellum Networks co-founder Ken Wang" (Kenzi Wang)** filed suit against the SAME defendants (Fred Jin et al.), **claiming they diverted about $58 million in Cere token assets**.

This means **Kenzi Wang is both a co-founder of the company being sued for $100M in RICO fraud AND a plaintiff in a separate lawsuit claiming $58M was diverted**. He is at the center of an unraveling billion-dollar fraud from both directions.

## 2. 🔥 CEREBELLUM NETWORKS v. KENZI WANG — $1.3M THEFT LAWSUIT (2023)
**Confidence: HIGH**

Cerebellum Networks Inc. (Cere Network itself) **sued Kenzi Wang** in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging **theft of $1.3 million** derived from the sale of crypto tokens.

Wang is described as "a resident of Dubai and a former advisor and independent contractor" to Cere.

**Source:**

  - Quote: "Complaint alleging the theft of $1.3 million derived from the sale of crypto tokens in Cerebellum Networks Inc. v. Kenzi Wang, described as a resident of Dubai and a former 'advisor and independent contractor' to the plaintiff"

---

## 3. 🔥 TRACTION LABS — FABRICATED NEA/LIGHTBANK FUNDING CLAIMS
**Confidence: HIGH**

Kenzi Wang has **repeatedly and consistently claimed** that Traction Labs "raised three rounds of funding from top-tier venture firms including New Enterprise Associates (NEA) and Lightbank." This claim appears on:
- Wikitia
- Crunchbase ("founded NEA backed Traction")
- The Network
- Kambria advisor announcement
- Symbolic Capital bio

**THE TRUTH:** The actual 2014 TechCrunch article covering Traction's Y Combinator Demo Day reveals the real investors were:
- **Digital Garage**
- **500 Startups**
- **Ullas Naik**
- **and others**

**There is ZERO evidence of NEA or Lightbank involvement.** A search for NEA portfolio investments in Buzzstarter or Traction Labs returns zero results.

Additionally, on Signal NFX, his profile lists: "Founder Traction Labs Inc 2013 - 2018" — yet the Reddit thread from December 2017 says the marketplace "disappeared by end of 2015" and "no termination of operation announcement was ever posted."

**Sources:**
- TechCrunch (August 19, 2014): https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/19/traction-launch/
  - Quote: "The company has already raised funding from Digital Garage, 500 Startups, Ullas Naik, and others."
  - Title: "Y Combinator-Backed Traction Is A Marketplace Connecting Brands With Freelance Marketers"
- Reddit r/PPC: https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/7mi7s3/why_did_traction_fail/
  - Quote: "the marketplace disappeared by the end of 2015, and today, they have reverted into an 'interactive advertising agency'"
- No results for NEA investing in Traction/Buzzstarter in any database

---

## 4. 🔥 TRACTION LABS "ACQUISITION" — NO EVIDENCE EXISTS
**Confidence: HIGH**

Kenzi claims Traction Labs was "successfully acquired in 2017" (Wikitia). His Symbolic Capital bio says "a successful exit from my web2 tech startup."

**No acquirer has EVER been named.** No acquisition announcement exists. The Wikitia reference for this claim links to a fabricated TechCrunch article: `https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/10/traction-labs-acquired/` — this URL returns **404 Not Found**.

Meanwhile, the Reddit thread from December 2017 asks "Why did Traction fail?" and notes the marketplace vanished with "no termination of operation announcement."

**The likely reality:** Traction failed, didn't get acquired, and Kenzi later fabricated the "successful exit" narrative.

**Sources:**
- Fabricated TechCrunch URL: https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/10/traction-labs-acquired/ → **404 Not Found**
- Tracxn: https://tracxn.com/d/companies/traction-labs/__lrZwGRyuLPpebivd3nEnxSDjI5aQJYWoCSk7YaaZJFQ
  - Quote: "Traction Labs has made no investments or acquisitions yet"

---

## 5. 🔥 DOMAIN ARBITRATION — FULL DETAILS (FA1709001750913)
**Confidence: HIGH**

The full FORUM/UDRP case is now documented. **Traction Corporation v. Ken Zi Wang** (FA1709001750913), decided October 2017.

Key findings:
- Traction Corporation (the REAL company with the TRACTION trademark since 2001) sued "Ken Zi Wang" for **7 domain names**: gotraction.com, tractionconf.com, tractionconference.com, tractionlabsinc.com, tractionlabsmedia.com, tractionventure.com, and traction.co
- Wang registered these domains using **multiple aliases** linked to buzzstarter.com email addresses
- Wang used some domains to offer "digital marketing campaign services that are highly similar to, and directly compete with" Traction Corporation's services
- Some domains resolved to "inactive or parked websites"
- Wang used a **privacy service** to hide ownership of traction.co — the Panel found this was "additional evidence of bad faith"
- In 2014, Traction Corporation contacted Wang about concerns; he "provided Complainant with assurances" but continued the infringing behavior
- **Wang did not respond to the complaint** — Panel issued default judgment
- All 7 domains were ordered transferred to Traction Corporation
- The Complainant was represented by **K&L Gates LLP**

**This reveals:** Wang essentially squatted on another company's trademark domains, used them to compete with the trademark holder, hid behind privacy services and aliases, ignored the legal proceedings entirely, and lost by default.

## 6. 🔥 WIKITIA PAGE — AT LEAST 5 FABRICATED REFERENCES
**Confidence: HIGH**

The Kenzi Wang Wikitia page (https://wikitia.com/wiki/Kenzi_Wang) contains multiple citations to articles that **DO NOT EXIST**:

| # | Claimed Reference | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `techcrunch.com/2017/03/10/traction-labs-acquired/` | **404 Not Found** |
| 2 | `techcrunch.com/2022/08/17/symbolic-capital-launch-kenzi-wang/` | **404 Not Found** |

| 5 | `forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2018/01/15/huobi-expands-us-market/` | **403/Not accessible** (likely fabricated) |

The Wikitia page also makes the dubious claim that Wang "has supported notable startups, including **Tesla, SpaceX, Perplexity, and Apptronik**" — this claim appears ONLY on Wikitia and nowhere else. No database (Crunchbase, Tracxn, PitchBook, etc.) lists these investments.

## 7. 🔥 $ELE MEME COIN SCANDAL — KENZI WANG IMPLICATED IN POLYGON INSIDER PUMP-AND-DUMP
**Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH**

In May 2024, community member Rahul Ghangas (@Rahul__Ghangas) published a detailed exposé alleging that Kenzi Wang and other Polygon insiders **orchestrated a meme coin pump-and-dump scheme** using $ELE (Elecoin).

**Named participants:**
- **Kenzi Wang** — Partner at Symbolic Capital, advisor to Polygon
- **Jack Lu** — Co-founder of Multibit/BounceBit, partner at NGC Ventures
- **Sanket Shah** — Strategic lead at Polygon Labs
- **Sachi Kamiya** — Founding team of Polygon Ventures, "part-time venture partner at Symbolic, and dating Kenzi"
- **Jiayi Li** — GP at GeekCartel, co-founder of Salus Security

**How it worked:**
- Token generation event occurred secretly in December 2023, with most supply controlled by insiders
- January 3, 2024: KOLs gathered in a Telegram group to promote $ELE
- Developers and KOLs were promised USDC compensation but never paid
- Insiders continuously sold tokens while developers promoted the project
- Market cap crashed from **$17 million to $2 million** as early wallets dumped
- The premise was that Polygon's Sandeep Nailwal "has a pet elephant" — turned out to be a rescued elephant Sandeep made a small donation to
- Kenzi Wang himself authorized domain access for the project website
- After the collapse, Kenzi "still had the courage to propose raising funds for the meme coin fund"

**Key quote from exposé:**
> "I want to remind everyone that @zachxbt has posted about Kenzi and his former fund, threatening and abusing the founders."

## 8. 🔥 ZACHXBT POSTED ABOUT KENZI WANG THREATENING/ABUSING FOUNDERS
**Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH**

The $ELE exposé explicitly references a ZachXBT tweet (January 2022): https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1483577541587783690

Quote from the exposé: "I want to remind everyone that @zachxbt has posted about Kenzi and his former fund, **threatening and abusing the founders**."

The tweet itself could not be loaded (X requires JS), but its existence is referenced by multiple sources in the $ELE scandal coverage.

- Referenced in AiCoin article: https://www.aicoin.com/en/article/400105
- Tweet URL: https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1483577541587783690

## 9. BIO DISCREPANCIES ACROSS PLATFORMS
**Confidence: HIGH**

| Platform | Huobi Title | Huobi Dates | Traction Claim |
|---|---|---|---|
| Wikitia | VP of Global Operations + GM of Huobi US | 2017-2020 ("five-year tenure") | "Three rounds from NEA and Lightbank" |
| Symbolic Capital website | "one of the earliest employees" | Not specified | "successful exit from web2 startup, raised from top VCs like NEA" |
| Signal NFX | Not listed separately | Shows AU21 2017-Present overlapping | "Founder Traction Labs Inc 2013-2018" |
| MarketScreener | VP & General Manager | "since 2017" (present tense!) | N/A |
| The Org (Kambria) | "Director of Growth" | Not specified | N/A |
| Crunchbase | VP and General Manager | Not dated | "founded NEA backed Traction" |
| Kambria AMA (2018) | Not mentioned | Not mentioned | "CEO and Co-founder of Traction Labs" |
| Bitlearn (2018) | Not mentioned | Not mentioned | "participated in both YCombinator and 500 Startups" |
| Clay.earth | VP of Global Operations | Not specified | "Co-Founder and CEO at Traction Labs Inc" |

**Contradictions:**
1. Wikitia says "five-year tenure" at Huobi (2017-2020) — that's only 3 years, not 5
2. The Org lists him as "Director of Growth" while everywhere else says "Vice President"
3. MarketScreener STILL lists him as VP at Huobi "since 2017" in present tense
4. He claims NEA/Lightbank funding in some bios but YCombinator/500 Startups in others — the REAL investors per TechCrunch were Digital Garage, 500 Startups, and Ullas Naik
5. Traction Labs dates vary: 2013-2017 (Wikitia), 2013-2018 (Signal NFX), but marketplace died by end of 2015

## 10. KENZI WANG's REAL NAME CONFIRMED: "KEN ZI WANG"
**Confidence: HIGH**

Multiple sources confirm his legal name is **Ken Zi Wang**:
- FORUM arbitration: "Respondent is Ken Zi Wang"
- The Knot wedding website: "Sachi Kamiya and Ken Zi Wang's Wedding Website" (May 2025 wedding)
- TechCrunch 2014: "co-founder Ken Zi Wang"
- MEXC: "Cerebellum Networks co-founder Ken Wang"

**Sources:**
- FORUM: https://www.adrforum.com/domaindecisions/1750913.htm
- The Knot: https://www.theknot.com/us/sachi-kamiya-and-ken-zi-wang-may-2025

---

## 11. KENZI WANG — ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH POLYGON VENTURES INSIDER
**Confidence: HIGH**

Kenzi Wang is engaged to/married **Sachi Kamiya**, who is:
- **Founding team member of Polygon Ventures**
- **Part-time venture partner at Symbolic Capital** (Kenzi's own fund!)
- **Now at Sentient Labs** (the $85M project Kenzi is a core contributor to)

This creates massive **conflicts of interest**: Kenzi advises Polygon, his partner works at Polygon Ventures, she also works at Symbolic Capital (his fund), and now both work at Sentient.

**Sources:**
- The Knot: https://www.theknot.com/us/sachi-kamiya-and-ken-zi-wang-may-2025
- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sachi-kamiya-38552a128/
- ChainCatcher: "Sachi Kamiya: Founding team of Polygon Ventures, part-time venture partner at Symbolic, and dating Kenzi"

---

## 12. SENTIENT AI — KENZI IS A "CORE CONTRIBUTOR" VIA "SENSYS"
**Confidence: HIGH**

Kenzi Wang founded **Sensys**, described as "an AI venture development startup" that is a **core contributor to Sentient** (the $85M AI project co-led by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund).

The other core contributors are:
- **Sandeep Nailwal** (Polygon co-founder — Kenzi's business partner at Symbolic)
- **Pramod Viswanath** (Princeton professor)
- **Himanshu Tyagi** (IISc professor)

This means a person with a Grand Theft charge, multiple lawsuits, and a Dubai arrest is a **core contributor** to an $85M venture backed by Peter Thiel's fund. The question is whether Founders Fund, Pantera Capital, Framework Ventures, and the other investors know about his criminal record.

**Sources:**
- The Block: https://www.theblock.co/post/302983/peter-thiel-founders-fund-sentient-funding-ai-polygon
  - Quote: "The startup, Sensys, was founded by Kenzi Wang, co-founder of Symbolic Capital, and aims to support startups within the Sentient ecosystem."

## 13. ADDITIONAL ENTITY: HYPEREDGE CAPITAL
**Confidence: HIGH**

Tracxn lists Kenzi Wang as founder of **3 companies**: AU21 Capital, **Hyperedge Capital**, and Cere Network.

Hyperedge Capital invested in nCore Games ($10M round, January 2022). This is yet another fund entity — in addition to AU21 Capital, Symbolic Capital, and Sensys.

## 14. HBUS / HUOBI US SHUTDOWN — DECEMBER 2019
**Confidence: HIGH (regarding shutdown, MEDIUM regarding Kenzi's role)**

HBUS (Huobi US) **abruptly ceased operations on December 15, 2019**, citing "regulatory concerns." Trading volumes had fallen to ~$220,000/day with only 56 trading pairs.

While Kenzi claims he was "VP and General Manager" and "played a foundational role in Huobi's global growth," the exchange collapsed under his watch. No formal SEC/FinCEN enforcement actions were found specifically naming HBUS, but the shutdown was clearly under regulatory pressure.

**Sources:**
- CoinTelegraph: https://cointelegraph.com/news/huobis-us-based-crypto-trading-platform-hbus-ceases-operations
  - Quote: "the American regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies had forced it to prohibit U.S.-based users from the platform"
- CoinDesk: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/09/huobi-us-is-abruptly-halting-exchange-operations
- CoinSpeaker: "Our trading services will not be available starting December 15, 2019, 20:30 PT/23:30 ET"

---

## 15. CERE NETWORK — GLASSDOOR REVIEWS REVEAL TOXIC COMPANY
**Confidence: MEDIUM (relates to Fred Jin primarily, but Kenzi co-founded it)**

Glassdoor reviews for Cere Network are devastating:
- "Fred Jin worst CEO ever, hostile workplace"
- "CEO Fred Jin is incapable, extremely insecure and mentally challenged"
- "Regulators should look into it asap as they are just putting up a front of a fake workplace to slowly rug investors and employees"
- "Terrible CEO and toxic work culture"
- "Biggest mistake in my career to accept Cere Network's offer"
- "no product-market fit and no structured approach to product discovery"

**Kenzi Wang co-founded this company** and is still listed as co-founder on multiple platforms.

**Source:**
- Glassdoor: https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Cere-Network-Reviews-E6360361.htm

---

## 16. BUZZSTARTER — THE ORIGINAL COMPANY NAME
**Confidence: HIGH**

Traction Labs was originally **Buzzstarter**, founded in 2006 (per Reddit) or 2013 (per other sources). This is important because:
- The domain arbitration reveals domains were registered using **buzzstarter.com email addresses**
- The Crunchbase profile for Traction (the Kenzi version) is actually filed under "buzzstarter-inc"
- PitchBook lists Kenzi as "co-founded and served as Chief Executive Officer at Buzzstarter"
- Tracxn lists 3 co-founders: Kenzi Wang, **Alexi Nedeltchev**, and **Alex Gold**

**Sources:**
- Tracxn: https://tracxn.com/d/companies/buzzstarter/__QABMHgMywWnUL8jzddwoy8fkHcBMj7YetN16qexRVzw/founders-and-board-of-directors
- PitchBook: https://pitchbook.com/profiles/person/46834-75P
- AdExchanger (2015): https://www.adexchanger.com/platforms/buzzstarter-grabs-attention-for-organic-content-with-paid-distribution/
- GitHub: https://github.com/kenziwang (lists "Buzzstarter" as organization)

## 17. DEAD/FAILED PROJECTS KENZI ADVISED OR INVESTED IN
**Confidence: HIGH**

Pattern of projects Kenzi Wang was associated with that collapsed:

| Project | Role | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **SuperBloom (SEED)** | Co-founder | Dead — scam warnings on BitcoinTalk |
| **Cere Network (CERE)** | Co-founder | 99%+ price collapse, $100M RICO lawsuit |
| **Wanaka Farm (WANA)** | Strategic Advisor | Token at $0.001715 — effectively dead |
| **Bitlearn (BLB)** | Advisory Board | Appears dead/inactive |
| **$ELE (Elecoin)** | Implicated as organizer | Crashed from $17M to $2M market cap |
| **Kambria** | Advisor | Token severely declined |
| **HBUS (Huobi US)** | VP/GM | Ceased operations Dec 2019 |
| **Traction Labs** | CEO/Co-founder | Marketplace vanished by 2015 |

---

## 18. ADDITIONAL TIMELINE NOTE: WHEN DID CERE RAISE AND FROM WHOM?
**Confidence: HIGH**

Per the $100M lawsuit:
- Cerebellum Networks was established in **January 2019** after raising approximately **$42.9 million**
- Cere raised nearly **$50 million** through private and public token sales in **November 2021**
- Republic.com listed Cere's team as: Fred Jin (General Contributor), **Kenzi Wang** (General Contributor), Ian Duggan (Technical Contributor), **Martijn Broersma** (unspecified)

**Sources:**
- CoinDesk: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/01/29/investors-accuse-cere-network-of-usd100m-fraud-and-token-dump-scheme-in-lawsuit
- MEXC: https://www.mexc.com/news/587842

---

## 19. SANDEEP NAILWAL EXPOSURE
**Confidence: HIGH**

Sandeep Nailwal (Polygon co-founder) is deeply entangled with Kenzi:
- **Co-founded Symbolic Capital** ($50M fund, August 2022)
- **Core contributor to Sentient** alongside Kenzi
- Named in the **$ELE meme coin scandal** alongside Kenzi
- **Has NOT responded** to allegations about the meme coin scam (per TechFlow)

The question: Does Sandeep know about Kenzi's Grand Theft charge, Dubai arrest, and investor fraud allegations? If he does and continued partnering, it's complicity. If he doesn't, it's a failure of due diligence of spectacular proportions.

**Source:**
- TechFlow: https://www.techflowpost.com/en-US/article/18904
  - Quote: "Kenzi Wang, along with Sandeep and other senior Polygon executives, was alleged to have orchestrated a MEME coin scam, though Sandeep has not responded to these allegations"

---

## 20. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY / WHARTON — STILL UNVERIFIED
**Confidence: LOW (for the claims being false)**

Multiple sources repeat the claim that Kenzi studied Mathematics at Columbia University and earned an MBA from Wharton. These claims appear on:
- Crunchbase
- Everipedia 
- Signal NFX
- Steemit (Kambria advisor post)
- Bitlearn advisory post
- Symbolic Capital bio (mentions "soccer to rugby at Columbia")

No alumni directory or verification was found to confirm or deny. The Symbolic Capital bio's reference to "transitioning from soccer to rugby at Columbia" could potentially be verified through Columbia athletics records.

**Note:** The Wikitia reference for education claims links to "Kenzi Wang LinkedIn Profile" — which is not independently verifiable.
