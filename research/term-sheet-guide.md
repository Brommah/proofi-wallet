## 2. Key Terms Deep Dive

### 2.1 Valuation (Pre-Money vs Post-Money)

#### How It Works

```
Post-Money Valuation = Pre-Money Valuation + Investment Amount
Investor Ownership = Investment Amount ÷ Post-Money Valuation
Founder Dilution = Investment Amount ÷ Post-Money Valuation
```

**Example:**
```
Pre-money: $20M
Investment: $5M
Post-money: $25M
Investor ownership: $5M ÷ $25M = 20%
```

#### The Option Pool Shuffle

**Critical concept:** Option pool increases from pre-money dilute founders, not investors.

```
Without pool expansion:
Pre-money: $20M (founders own 100%)
Investment: $5M
Post-money: $25M
Founder ownership: $20M ÷ $25M = 80%

With 15% pool from pre-money:
Pre-money: $20M (85% founders + 15% pool)
Investment: $5M  
Post-money: $25M
Founder ownership: $17M ÷ $25M = 68%
Effective valuation: $17M
```

#### 2024 Market Benchmarks

| Metric | Seed | Series A | Series B |
|--------|------|----------|----------|
| **ARR Multiple** | 50-100x | 20-50x | 10-30x |
| **Pre-money range** | $5-15M | $15-50M | $40-150M |
| **Typical dilution** | 15-25% | 15-25% | 10-20% |

#### Negotiation Points

✅ **Push for:**
- Post-money option pool (rare but worth asking)
- Smaller pool based on 18-month hiring plan
- Milestone-based tranches to reduce dilution

❌ **Watch out for:**
- Large pre-money option pool increases
- Exploding term sheets designed to prevent shopping
- "Headline" valuation that ignores pool shuffle

### 2.2 Liquidation Preferences

#### Types Explained

**Non-Participating Preferred (Standard):**
```
Investor chooses EITHER:
(a) Get 1x investment back, OR
(b) Convert to common and share pro-rata

Exit at $10M (1x): Investor takes $5M preference
Exit at $50M (10x): Investor converts for 20% = $10M (better than $5M)
```

**Participating Preferred (Double-Dip):**
```
Investor gets BOTH:
(a) 1x investment back, AND
(b) Pro-rata share of remainder

Exit at $50M: $5M preference + 20% of $45M = $5M + $9M = $14M
(vs $10M with non-participating)
```

**Participating with Cap:**
```
Investor gets preference + participation UP TO cap (e.g., 3x)

Exit at $50M with 3x cap: 
Participation formula gives $14M
But capped at 3 × $5M = $15M
Actually take $14M (under cap)
```

#### Seniority Stack

```
Standard (Pari Passu):          Stacked (Senior):
┌─────────────────────┐         ┌─────────────────────┐
│    Series B: $10M   │         │   Series B: $10M    │ ← Paid first
│    Series A: $5M    │         ├─────────────────────┤
│    Seed: $2M        │         │   Series A: $5M     │ ← Paid second
└─────────────────────┘         ├─────────────────────┤
Paid proportionally             │   Seed: $2M         │ ← Paid third
($17M at same time)             └─────────────────────┘
```

#### Real Impact Analysis

| Exit Value | Non-Part 1x | Part 1x | Part 1x Capped 3x |
|------------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| $10M | I: $5M, F: $5M | I: $6M, F: $4M | I: $6M, F: $4M |
| $25M | I: $5M, F: $20M | I: $9M, F: $16M | I: $9M, F: $16M |
| $50M | I: $10M, F: $40M | I: $14M, F: $36M | I: $14M, F: $36M |
| $100M | I: $20M, F: $80M | I: $24M, F: $76M | I: $15M, F: $85M |

*I = Investor (20% ownership, $5M invested), F = Founders/Common*

### 2.3 Anti-Dilution Protection

#### Broad-Based Weighted Average (Standard)

Protects investors if company raises at lower price ("down round").

```
New Price = Old Price × (A + B) / (A + C)

A = Pre-issuance fully diluted shares
B = Shares that WOULD be issued at original price
C = Shares ACTUALLY issued at new (lower) price

Example:
Series A at $1/share, 10M shares outstanding
Down round at $0.50/share, raising $2M (4M new shares)

A = 10M
B = $2M ÷ $1 = 2M
C = $2M ÷ $0.50 = 4M

New Price = $1 × (10M + 2M) / (10M + 4M) = $0.857
Series A conversion price adjusts from $1 to $0.857
Series A gets ~17% more shares upon conversion
```

#### Full Ratchet (Investor-Friendly, Avoid)

```
Any down round = Series A price resets to new price entirely

Same example:
Series A price resets from $1 to $0.50
Series A gets 2x the shares upon conversion
Massively dilutive to founders
```

#### Pay-to-Play

Requires investors to participate in down rounds to keep anti-dilution protection.

```
RECOMMENDED ADDITION:

Pay-to-Play: Investors must purchase their pro-rata share of any
down-round financing to maintain anti-dilution protection. 
Non-participating investors convert to Common or shadow preferred.
```

### 2.4 Board Composition

#### Typical Structures by Stage

| Stage | Size | Common | Preferred | Independent |
|-------|------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Seed** | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
| **Series A** | 5 | 2 | 2 | 1 |
| **Series B+** | 5-7 | 2 | 2-3 | 1-2 |

#### Control Analysis

```
5-Person Board Scenarios:

Founder Control (Safe):    Balanced:             Investor Control (Risk):
├── Founder 1             ├── Founder 1          ├── Founder 1
├── Founder 2             ├── Founder 2          ├── Investor 1
├── Founder 3             ├── Investor 1         ├── Investor 2
├── Investor 1            ├── Investor 2         ├── Investor 3
└── Independent           └── Independent        └── Independent
    (Founder pick)            (Mutual)               (Investor pick)
```

#### Key Provisions

```
BOARD GOVERNANCE

Meetings: Quarterly minimum, more frequent as needed
Quorum: Majority, must include at least one Preferred Director

Written consent: Unanimous for action without meeting

Committees:
- Compensation Committee: [composition]
- Audit Committee: [composition] (if applicable)

Board Matters requiring investor director approval:

- Related party transactions > $[50,000]
- [others as negotiated]
```

### 2.5 Protective Provisions

#### Standard List

| Category | Typical Provisions | Negotiate? |
|----------|-------------------|------------|
| **Charter changes** | Amendments affecting Preferred | Standard |
| **Capitalization** | New senior securities, share changes | Standard |
| **Liquidation events** | M&A, asset sales, dissolution | Standard |
| **Distributions** | Dividends, redemptions | Standard |
| **Debt** | Borrowing above threshold | Negotiate threshold |
| **Board** | Size changes | Sometimes removable |
| **Option pool** | Increases beyond approved | Negotiate threshold |
| **Related party** | Transactions with insiders | Negotiate threshold |

#### Founder-Friendly Modifications

```
RECOMMENDED CARVE-OUTS:

Debt threshold: $[500K-1M] (vs. any debt)
Related party threshold: $[100K] in aggregate annually
Option pool: No consent needed up to [15%] total
Sunset: Protective provisions terminate upon Qualified IPO

REMOVE IF POSSIBLE:
- Approval of annual budget
- Approval of key hires
- Approval of office leases
- Approval of ordinary course contracts
```

### 2.6 Pro-Rata Rights

#### How They Work

```
Scenario:
- Series A: VC owns 20%
- Series B: Company raising $20M at $80M pre ($100M post)
- Pro-rata right: VC can invest 20% × $20M = $4M to maintain 20%

Without exercising: VC diluted to 16% (20% × $80M/$100M)
With exercising: VC maintains 20%
```

#### Key Negotiation Points

| Term | Founder-Friendly | Investor-Friendly |
|------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Threshold** | $500K+ invested | All investors |
| **Scope** | Primary only | Primary + secondary |
| **Super pro-rata** | No | Right to increase % |
| **Transfer** | Non-transferable | Transferable |
| **Duration** | Expires at Series C | Through IPO |

```
RECOMMENDED LANGUAGE:

Major Investor Threshold: $[500,000]
Super Pro-Rata: Not included
Transfer: Only to affiliates under common control
Termination: Upon (i) IPO, or (ii) investor holding < [2]%
Waiver: 15 days to exercise, deemed waived if no response
```

### 2.7 Vesting

#### Standard Schedules

```
4-Year with 1-Year Cliff:

Year 1: 0% → 25% at cliff
Year 2: 25% → 50% (monthly)
Year 3: 50% → 75% (monthly)
Year 4: 75% → 100% (monthly)

Monthly vesting after cliff: 1/48 per month (or 1/36 remaining)
```

#### Acceleration Triggers

**Single Trigger:**
```
Upon Change of Control:
- [50-100]% of unvested shares accelerate immediately
- Controversial: investors dislike (reduces acquirer incentive)
```

**Double Trigger (Standard):**
```
Upon Change of Control AND termination/constructive termination:
- [50-100]% of unvested shares accelerate
- Termination must occur within [12-24] months of CoC
- Constructive termination: material role reduction, relocation, pay cut
```

#### Founder-Specific Considerations

```
FOUNDER VESTING NEGOTIATION:

Credit for time served:
- Pre-funding work counts toward vesting
- Example: 2 years working = 50% credit

Shorter schedule for existing founders:
- 3 years total vs. 4 years
- Acknowledge company-building to date

Acceleration carve-outs:
- Board removal without cause = acceleration
- Investor-forced CEO replacement = acceleration
```

### 2.8 Option Pool

#### Sizing the Pool

```
Hiring Plan Method (Recommended):

Role              | Number | % Each | Total %
─────────────────────────────────────────────
VP Engineering    | 1      | 1.5%   | 1.5%
VP Sales          | 1      | 1.0%   | 1.0%
VP Marketing      | 1      | 0.75%  | 0.75%
Senior Engineers  | 5      | 0.25%  | 1.25%
Mid-level hires   | 10     | 0.1%   | 1.0%
Refreshes         | -      | -      | 1.5%
─────────────────────────────────────────────
18-Month Need                        | 7.0%
Buffer (20%)                         | 1.4%
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Total Pool Needed                    | 8.4%

→ Negotiate for 10% vs. investor's 15%
```

#### Pre-Money vs Post-Money Impact

```
$20M Pre-Money, $5M Investment, 15% Pool

PRE-MONEY POOL (Standard):
Fully diluted pre-money: 100%
Pool: 15% (from pre-money)
Founders: 85%
Post-money: $25M
Founders own: 85% × ($20M/$25M) = 68%

POST-MONEY POOL (Rare, Founder-Friendly):
Pre-money to founders: 100%
Post-money: $25M
Pool: 15% of post = $3.75M equivalent
Founders own: ($20M - $0) / $25M × 85% = 85% × 80% = 68%
Wait, same? No—

Actually post-money pool means:
Investor: 20%
Pool: 15%
Founders: 65%

Pre-money pool means:
Investor: 20%
Pool: 15% × 80% = 12%
Founders: 68%

Post-money pool better for investors here—the key is WHERE 
the dilution comes from. Always model it out!
```

## 3. Negotiation Tactics

### 3.1 What to Push Back On

#### High Priority (Always Negotiate)

| Term | Why | Target |
|------|-----|--------|
| **Participating preferred** | Massive downside in exits | Non-participating 1x |
| **Full ratchet anti-dilution** | Destroys cap table in down round | Broad-based weighted average |
| **Super pro-rata rights** | Blocks future investors | Standard pro-rata only |
| **Excessive option pool** | Stealth valuation reduction | Pool based on hiring plan |
| **Founder vesting restart** | Unfair to existing work | Credit for time served |
| **Redemption rights** | Forced exit pressure | Remove or 7+ year term |

#### Medium Priority (Negotiate If Possible)

| Term | Why | Target |
|------|-----|--------|
| **Board seat for small check** | Over-representation | Board seat requires lead/major check |
| **Broad protective provisions** | Operational friction | Limited list, higher thresholds |
| **Information rights for all** | Administrative burden | Major investors only (>$250K) |
| **Founder non-competes** | Limits future options | 12 months max, narrow scope |
| **Milestone-based tranches** | Execution risk on company | Single close, or founder-friendly milestones |

### 3.2 What to Accept

#### Generally Acceptable

| Term | Why Acceptable |
|------|----------------|
| **1x non-participating liquidation preference** | Industry standard, fair |
| **Broad-based weighted average anti-dilution** | Standard protection |
| **Standard pro-rata rights** | Reasonable for committed investors |
| **4-year vesting with 1-year cliff** | Industry norm |
| **Board seat for lead investor** | Reasonable governance |
| **Standard information rights** | Transparency is healthy |
| **ROFR and co-sale** | Protects all parties |
| **D&O insurance requirement** | Protects everyone |

#### Accept with Conditions

| Term | Condition |
|------|-----------|
| **Drag-along** | Require minimum value threshold (2x preference) |
| **No-shop** | 30 days max, narrow scope |
| **Founder reps** | Limit to actual knowledge, cap liability |
| **Pay-to-play** | Actually founder-friendly if structured right |

### 3.3 Red Flags

#### Walk-Away Red Flags 🚩

| Red Flag | Why It's Bad |
|----------|--------------|
| **2x+ participating preferred** | Destroys common shareholder returns |
| **Full ratchet anti-dilution** | One down round = disaster |
| **Investor board majority at Series A** | Loss of control too early |
| **Redemption rights < 5 years** | Forced exit pressure |
| **Cumulative dividends 10%+** | Compounds against you |
| **Founder vesting clawback** | Can lose shares for past work |
| **No information rights symmetry** | Investors see everything, you see nothing |

#### Serious Concern Flags ⚠️

| Flag | Concern |
|------|---------|
| **Multiple board observers** | Meetings become unwieldy |
| **Approval rights on hiring** | Operational interference |
| **Annual budget approval** | Micromanagement |
| **Narrow anti-dilution carve-outs** | Routine grants trigger adjustment |
| **Excessive representations** | Liability risk |
| **Uncapped indemnification** | Personal exposure |

### 3.4 Walk-Away Points

#### Know Your BATNA (Best Alternative)

Before negotiating, know:
- Do you have other term sheets?
- Can you survive without this round?
- What's your runway?
- Are there strategic alternatives?

#### Non-Negotiable Minimums

```
SUGGESTED WALK-AWAY CHECKLIST:

□ Liquidation preference ≤ 1x non-participating
□ Anti-dilution is broad-based weighted average
□ Founders retain board control or true balance
□ Vesting credit for time served
□ Option pool ≤ 15% or justified by plan
□ No redemption rights (or 7+ years)
□ Protective provisions have reasonable thresholds
□ No personal guarantees
□ Founder-friendly IP assignment (prior work carved out)
```

#### When to Walk Away

1. **Deal math doesn't work:** Effective valuation (after pool shuffle) too low
2. **Control terms too aggressive:** Would hamper operations
3. **Investor reputation issues:** Reference checks reveal problems
4. **Terms signal distrust:** Excessive provisions suggest adversarial relationship
5. **Better alternatives exist:** And you're being pressured to decide

### 3.5 Negotiation Process Tips

#### Preparation

```
BEFORE RECEIVING TERM SHEET:

1. Research investor's typical terms (ask other founders)
2. Know market standards for your stage/metrics
3. Build your hiring plan (for option pool discussion)
4. Understand your leverage (other interest, runway)
5. Identify your must-haves vs. nice-to-haves
6. Have lawyer ready to review quickly
```

#### Receiving the Term Sheet

```
UPON RECEIPT:

1. Thank them, commit to quick turnaround
2. Read entire document before reacting
3. Model out the economics (cap table impact)
4. Identify deviations from market
5. Categorize issues: deal-breaker / important / minor
6. Discuss with co-founders and advisors
7. Prepare consolidated response (not piecemeal)
```

#### Negotiating

```
NEGOTIATION TACTICS:

DO:
✓ Negotiate in person or video when possible
✓ Package requests together (not one at a time)
✓ Use market data to justify positions
✓ Be direct about deal-breakers early
✓ Ask "why" to understand investor concerns
✓ Offer alternatives that address their concern differently
✓ Keep timeline moving (don't drag out)

DON'T:
✗ Nickel-and-dime every term
✗ Threaten to walk unless you mean it
✗ Renegotiate after agreeing
✗ Let lawyer be primary negotiator for business terms
✗ Be adversarial (you'll work together for years)
✗ Share other term sheets (usually backfires)
```

#### Closing

```
POST-AGREEMENT:

1. Sign term sheet promptly
2. Expect 4-8 weeks to definitive docs
3. Review drafts carefully (term sheet → docs gaps)
4. Don't let "standard" document changes slip in
5. Maintain momentum (delays kill deals)
6. Prepare for due diligence in parallel
```

## 4. Cere-Specific Considerations

### 4.1 Token Implications

#### Token vs. Equity Structure

```
STRUCTURE OPTIONS:

Option A: Equity Only
- Clean traditional VC structure
- Token as separate future event
- Investors get equity + possible token warrant/SAFT

Option B: Token Warrant/SAFT
- Investors get equity + right to future tokens
- Typically % of equity = % of token allocation
- Token allocation from "investor pool" (e.g., 15% of total supply)

Option C: Token-Linked Equity
- Equity value tied to token performance
- Complex, less common
```

#### Key Token Terms to Address

```
IF TOKENS EXIST OR ARE PLANNED:

Token Allocation:
- Investor allocation: [__]% of total supply
- Matching equity pro-rata or separate calculation?
- Vesting: Tokens vest parallel to equity?

Token Liquidity Provisions:
- Lockup period: [12-36] months post-launch
- Release schedule: [Linear / cliff / milestone-based]

Future Token Raises:
- Do equity investors have pro-rata on token sales?
- Token vs. equity financing hierarchy

Representations:
- Token not a security (regulatory risk allocation)
- Compliance with applicable law
```

#### Specific Considerations for Cere

```
CERE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS NEEDED:

1. Existing token situation:
   - Are tokens already issued?
   - Current token holder rights?
   - Lockup status?

2. Token/equity relationship:
   - How do existing investors hold tokens?
   - What rights do they have re: future tokens?
   - Parity expectations for new investors?

3. Regulatory positioning:
   - Jurisdiction of token issuance
   - Utility vs. security characterization
   - Implications for US investors

4. Dilution interactions:
   - Does equity dilution affect token allocation?
   - Separate cap tables or linked?
```

### 4.2 Existing Investor Rights

#### Pre-Series A Investor Analysis

```
CHECKLIST FOR EXISTING INVESTOR TERMS:

□ What liquidation preferences exist?
   - Stack or pari passu with new round?
   - Total preference stack amount?

□ Anti-dilution provisions:
   - Type (broad-based, narrow, ratchet)?
   - Will Series A trigger adjustment?
   
□ Pro-rata rights:
   - Who has them?
   - Will they exercise in Series A?
   - Allocation to new vs. existing investors?

□ Board seats/observers:
   - Current composition?
   - Rights to maintain seats?

□ Protective provisions:
   - What requires existing investor consent?
   - Potential blockers to Series A terms?

□ Information rights:
   - Ongoing obligations?
   - New investor rights at parity?
```

#### Negotiating Around Existing Terms

```
COMMON ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS:

Issue: Existing investors have participating preferred
Solution: 
- Negotiate to collapse to non-participating as condition of A
- Or accept but ensure Series A is senior/pari passu

Issue: Heavy liquidation preference stack
Solution:
- Model exit scenarios to ensure Common gets meaningful return
- Consider pay-to-play or conversion incentives

Issue: Existing investors want full pro-rata
Solution:
- Cap allocation to leave room for new lead
- Structure minimum new investor allocation

Issue: Existing protective provisions block new terms
Solution:
- Get consent early in process
- May need to offer something in exchange
```

### 4.3 International Structure Considerations

#### Multi-Jurisdiction Issues

```
TYPICAL WEB3/INTERNATIONAL STRUCTURE:

US HoldCo (Delaware C-Corp)
├── Equity investors invest here
├── US operations
└── IP ownership

Token SPV (Non-US, e.g., BVI, Cayman, Swiss)
├── Token issuance
├── Token treasury
└── Token-related obligations

Operating Entities
├── Development (various jurisdictions)
├── Foundation (if applicable)
└── Local operations
```

#### Key Structural Questions

```
FOR CERE SPECIFICALLY:

1. Current corporate structure:
   - Holding company jurisdiction?
   - Operating subsidiaries?
   - Token-related entities?

2. Where does investment go:
   - US entity (standard for US VCs)?
   - Need restructuring?
   - Tax implications?

3. IP and value location:
   - Where is IP held?
   - Transfer pricing arrangements?
   - Investor comfort with structure?

4. Token entity relationship:
   - Contractual link to equity entity?
   - Economic flow-through?
   - Governance/control relationship?
```

#### Structural Negotiation Points

```
INVESTOR CONCERNS TO ADDRESS:

1. US nexus: Many VCs need Delaware C-Corp
   - May need to flip or create US holding company
   
2. Regulatory clarity: Clear separation of token/equity
   - Clean structure documentation
   
3. Tax efficiency: Transfer pricing, repatriation
   - Professional tax structuring

4. Exit mechanics: How does acquisition work?
   - Clear path to liquidity for all instruments
   
5. Governance alignment: Token and equity interests
   - Unified decision-making where possible
```

## Appendix B: Key Formulas

### Valuation Math

```
Post-Money = Pre-Money + Investment
Ownership % = Investment ÷ Post-Money
Effective Pre-Money = Pre-Money - Pool Increase Value
Price/Share = Pre-Money ÷ Fully Diluted Shares (pre-close)
```

### Dilution

```
New Ownership = Old Ownership × (Old Post / New Post)
Dilution = 1 - (New Ownership / Old Ownership)
```

### Anti-Dilution (Broad-Based Weighted Average)

```
Adjusted Price = Original Price × (A + B) / (A + C)

A = Fully diluted shares pre-issuance
B = Shares at original price from new $: New $ ÷ Original Price
C = Shares actually issued: New $ ÷ New Lower Price
```

### Liquidation Waterfall

```
Non-Participating:
Preferred Payment = MIN(Preference, Exit Value)
Common Payment = MAX(0, Exit Value - Preference)
OR if converted: Everyone shares pro-rata

Participating:
Preferred Payment = Preference + (Exit - Preference) × Preferred%
Common Payment = (Exit - Preference) × Common%
```
