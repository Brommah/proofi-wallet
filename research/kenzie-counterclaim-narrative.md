# NARRATIVE FOR COUNSEL
## Cerebellum Network Inc. — Response to Goopal Digital Ltd. / Vivian Liu Complaint

**Prepared for:** Fred Jin / Legal Counsel  
**Date:** February 5, 2026  
**Classification:** PRIVILEGED & CONFIDENTIAL — Attorney Work Product

---

## THE STORY IN BRIEF

Vivian Liu's complaint against Cere Network was orchestrated by **Kenzi Wang** (a/k/a Jin Wang) — the same individual against whom Cere Network has an outstanding civil complaint and who is currently facing criminal prosecution in Dubai. This lawsuit is manufactured retaliation for Cere's own legal action against him.

The irony is striking: **Kenzi Wang stole Vivian Liu's tokens himself, then directed her to sue Cere for the theft he committed.**

---

## 1. CONTEXT: WHO IS KENZI WANG

Kenzi Wang (co-founder of AU21 Capital) was an investor and advisor to Cere Network. He is currently:

- **Defendant in Cere's existing California civil complaint** — for irregular capital transfers, diversion of token-sale proceeds to personal wallets, misstatements, and intimidation
- **Subject of criminal prosecution in Dubai** — arrested, interrogated, released on bail with passport surrendered and an active travel ban (Cases No. 31801/2025 and 33359/2025, Dubai Criminal Court)
- **Hearing date: February 26, 2026** — judge to rule on further prosecution; potential sentence up to 5 years

He has a documented pattern of using manufactured complaints and media manipulation to smear parties he views as adversaries — including orchestrating the one-sided CoinDesk article ("Investors accuse Cere Network of $100M fraud," published January 29, 2026) without any comment from Cere.

## 2. THE RETALIATION

Cere Network filed its complaint against Kenzi Wang first. In response, Kenzi orchestrated Vivian Liu's lawsuit (*Goopal Digital Ltd. v. Jin Wang et al.*, Case No. 3:26-cv-00857, N.D. Cal., filed January 27, 2026).

**The timeline speaks for itself:**
- Cere's original complaint against Kenzi → outstanding and active
- Dubai criminal cases filed → Kenzi arrested
- Days later → Vivian Liu files a RICO complaint naming Cere's leadership

Anyone reading both complaints will recognize: this is coordinated retaliation by someone facing criminal consequences who is trying to muddy the waters and create leverage.

## 3. THE MANUFACTURED THEFT

The central claim in Vivian Liu's complaint — that Cere stole her 33,333,334 CERE tokens — is a lie manufactured by the very person who actually stole them. The on-chain evidence is conclusive:

### How Kenzi stole Vivian's tokens:

**a) He made himself the sole contact.**  
In December 2021, Kenzi told the team on Slack: *"I'll handle Vivian."* From that point, no one at Cere had independent contact with the investor. He knew she was pregnant and hard to reach — he exploited this.

**b) He inserted a fake wallet address.**  
A wallet Vivian never controlled was entered into Cere's investor distribution mastersheet. Vivian herself confirms she never provided a mainnet wallet address. Google Sheets edit history shows the address was entered by a **"deleted user"** — the account (belonging to Andrei Kinstler, who worked closely with Kenzi) was deleted after the retention period, destroying the audit trail.

**c) Tokens were distributed — and immediately drained.**  
- **March 25, 2022:** 13,333,334 CERE sent to the fake wallet
- **Within ~8 hours:** Entire balance drained via test-then-sweep pattern (2 CERE test → 3.3M → 30M → 1 dust cleanup) to an intermediary, then returned full circle to a Cere company wallet
- **May 10, 2022:** 20,000,000 CERE sent to the same fake wallet — same drainage pattern

**Vivian received zero tokens.** This was a fabricated "distribution" that existed on paper only.

**d) Two years later, Kenzi bridged the stolen tokens and cashed out.**  
- **January 6, 2024:** 33,333 CERE test bridge from Cere mainnet → Polygon → Ethereum → sold on KuCoin
- **January 7, 2024:** 33,299,997.97 CERE (the full amount) — same path → sold on KuCoin
- **Test-then-full pattern:** deliberate, cautious, operational behavior — not legitimate investor activity

**e) Kenzi's own wallet funded the operation.**  
- **February 1–2, 2024:** A wallet forensically identified as belonging to Kenzi Wang sent ETH to the bridge wallet used to cash out stolen tokens (gas funding for transactions)
- **That same wallet** holds 276M CERE tokens + the #1 holder position in both Skyrim Finance (38.26% supply) and Raze Network (16.82% supply) — two AU21 Capital portfolio projects. No other wallet on any blockchain holds this combination. It is uniquely Kenzi's.

## 4. THE FAKE ADVISER

Vivian Liu's complaint claims she performed "several hundred hours" of advisory work for Cere Network. This is false:

- **No work logs exist** — Vivian never submitted any deliverables to Cere
- **No invoices** — She never invoiced the company for any work
- **No communications** — There are no emails, messages, or calls between Vivian and anyone at Cere about advisory work
- **Everything routed through Kenzi** — The sole conduit for all Vivian-related communication was Kenzi Wang himself
- **Unreachable** — When Cere tried to contact Vivian directly (November 2023), she briefly engaged through "Kevin" (a co-plaintiff), then went completely silent
- **No demand for tokens** — In the entire history, Vivian never once demanded her 20M advisory tokens until this lawsuit appeared
- **The advisory agreement** was signed as "Lujunjin Liu" — a name she uses — but no evidence exists that she ever performed under it

5,000+ Republic investors and 160+ private investors all received their tokens through Cere's standard distribution process. **Vivian Liu is the only exception** — because Kenzi intercepted her distribution.

## 5. THE PROOF

All of the above is supported by:

1. **Immutable blockchain records** — every transaction traceable on Cere mainnet, Polygon, and Ethereum with block numbers and tx hashes
2. **Slack messages** — Kenzi stating "I'll handle Vivian" (December 23, 2021)
3. **Google Sheets audit history** — "deleted user" entered the fake wallet address
4. **Wallet forensic identification** — Kenzi's Ethereum wallet uniquely identified via AU21 portfolio cross-reference (CERE + SKYRIM #1 + RAZE #1)
5. **Funding flow** — Kenzi's wallet directly funded the bridge wallet used to liquidate stolen tokens
6. **Exchange records** — All stolen CERE sold on KuCoin (subpoena-ready)
7. **Vivian's own confirmation** — She states she never provided a mainnet wallet address (supporting that it was fabricated)
8. **Active January 2026 CERE liquidation** — Kenzi's wallet selling hundreds of thousands of CERE weekly while the lawsuit was being filed

---

## 6. THE ASK

The narrative for any reader — whether judge, counsel, journalist, or investor — should be:

> **Kenzi Wang stole an investor's tokens, waited two years, cashed them out, then directed that same investor to sue the company he stole from — as retaliation for the company's own legal action against him. Every element of this scheme is documented on the blockchain and in internal communications.**

This complaint should be met with:
1. **Counterclaim** — Cerebellum Network Inc. against Kenzi Wang for the Vivian token theft
2. **Reference to Cere's existing complaint** — demonstrating the pattern and establishing motive
3. **Communication to plaintiff's counsel** — informing them their client may be a victim of the very person orchestrating her lawsuit
4. **Dubai admissibility** — filing before February 26, 2026 hearing date
