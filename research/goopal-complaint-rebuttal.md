## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Goopal complaint (filed January 27, 2026) presents a narrative that is fundamentally false and was orchestrated by **Kenzi Wang** (a/k/a Ken Zi Wang, Jin Wang) — the very person who stole Vivian Liu's 33,333,334 CERE tokens. The blockchain evidence is definitive: Kenzi inserted a fake wallet address, diverted Vivian's token allocation, bridged the tokens through Polygon to Ethereum, and sold the entire amount on KuCoin within 24 hours. He then directed his victim (Vivian Liu) to sue Cere Network — creating a smokescreen to deflect from his own theft.

**This rebuttal addresses 28+ allegations from the complaint, organized as follows:**

- **Core fraud narrative** (Allegations 1–3)
- **Fund siphoning, Gotbit/wash trading, price decline, "pattern of fraud"** (Allegations 4–6)
- **RICO and conspiracy** (Allegation 7)
- **Advisory agreement claims** (Allegation 8)
- **All individual defendants** — Brad Bao, Francois Granade, Maren Schwarzer, Xin Jin, Martijn Broersma (Allegations 9, 11–16)
- **Entity defendants / "shell company" claims** — Cerebellum Network Inc., Interdata Network Ltd., CEF AI Inc. with industry comparisons (Allegations 10, 17–19)
- **Vivian Liu's backstory, promises, and introduction** (Allegations 27–29)
- **Vivian's advisory agreement, scope, compensation, work performed, and the critical entity naming discrepancy** (Allegations 37–44)
- **Jin's specific representations to Liu** — lock-ups, Fortune 500 claims, Expedia, fund usage (Allegation 45a–e)
- **"Pattern of fraud" narrative** (Funler → Bitlearn → Cere) vs. the actual documented pattern of Kenzi Wang (Allegations 46–47)
- **Fundraising details** — $42.96M breakdown, SAFT structure, Republic/DAO Maker/Polkastarter platforms, and the critical fact that ALL 5,160+ investors received tokens (Allegations 48–50)
- **Goopal agreement entity** — "Cere Network (BVI), Ltd." naming discrepancy, same pattern as Allegation 39 (Allegation 54)
- **Goopal's $100K investment** — investment terms, USDT transfer, token allocation, and Kenzi's interception (Allegations 55, 58)
- **Tokenomics breakdown** — 10B token allocation across 11 categories, conservative 5% leadership allocation, all publicly disclosed (Allegations 59–60)
- **Vesting schedules** — standard industry terms, publicly documented, verifiable on-chain (Allegation 61)
- **Tokenomics publication by Jin and Broersma** — standard transparency required by platforms, not fraud (Allegation 62)
- **Jin's representations to Liu** — token promises, partnerships, vesting commitments, and the blanket "all were false" assertion (Allegations 63–65)

**The Martijn Broersma rebuttal (Allegation 13) is the most extensively documented as he is our principal.** The entity rebuttals (Allegations 17–19) include comparisons to Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, etc. as specifically requested by Matt. **The Vivian advisory rebuttals (Allegations 40–44) and the "Critical Observation" section establish the factual chain proving Vivian is suing the wrong defendant** — and articulate the strategic framing for the TPC/counterclaim: *"We agree Vivian was wronged. We disagree on who wronged her."*

**Key facts the complaint omits:**

- An independent investigation by **Practus LLP** (March–July 2024) found **"no evidence to support Wang's allegations regarding Fred Jin's misappropriation of Company funds."**
- A forensic audit by **DHTY** confirmed that **Kenzi Wang** diverted **$4,817,900** to personal wallets and wallets outside company control.
- **5,000+ Republic investors** and **160+ private investors** all received their tokens without incident — **Vivian Liu is the sole exception**, and she is the one investor where Kenzi Wang inserted himself as exclusive intermediary.
- Kenzi Wang was **arrested in Dubai**, held for one day, surrendered his passport, and has an **active travel ban**. Two criminal cases (31801/2025 & 33359/2025) are before the Dubai Criminal Court with a hearing on **February 26, 2026**.
- Kenzi Wang has a **Grand Theft charge** from 2018 (SF County Superior Court, Case No. 18017577, Cal. PC § 487(a)).
- Kenzi Wang filed his **own $58M derivative complaint** in Delaware Chancery accusing Fred Jin of exactly what he (Kenzi) did — textbook **DARVO** (Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender).

**The real story:** Both Vivian Liu and Cere Network are victims of the same criminal — Kenzi Wang. This lawsuit is the final phase of his scheme: steal from both sides, then pit the victims against each other while he liquidates the remaining stolen assets.

## 2. ALLEGATION-BY-ALLEGATION REBUTTAL

---

### ALLEGATION 1

> *"Fred Jin was the ringleader in one of the largest crypto frauds in history. Jin conspired with his family members to defraud the public in a classic pump and dump scheme, and stole tens of millions of dollars from both investors and employees."*

**VERDICT: FALSE**

#### Rebuttal

Fred Jin founded and led Cere Network as a legitimate technology company. The independent Practus LLP investigation (March–July 2024), which included forensic accounting by DHTY and interviews with all relevant parties, concluded:

> **"No evidence to support Wang's allegations regarding Fred Jin's misappropriation of Company funds."**

Both Fred Jin and Martijn Broersma were found **credible** in their interviews. The forensic audit confirmed the opposite of the complaint's narrative: it was **Kenzi Wang** who diverted funds and stole tokens.

#### The Actual Fraud — Committed by Kenzi Wang

**The Vivian Liu Token Theft (33.3M CERE):**

1. **December 23, 2021:** Kenzi Wang volunteered in Slack as sole contact for Vivian Liu — *"I'll handle Vivian"* / *"I'll take Vivian and Jacky."* From that moment, no one at Cere communicated directly with Vivian.

2. **Cover story:** Kenzi reported Vivian was pregnant and wanted tokens staked — explaining away the lack of updated documents and why she never provided her own wallet address.

3. **Late 2021–Early 2022:** A wallet address Vivian never provided was inserted into the distribution mastersheet by a **"deleted user"** (Google Sheets edit history). Only 5 people had write access: AK, AN, Sieb, Fred, Martijn. AN was cleared ("actively helped searching"). AK's Google Workspace was deleted after the 20-day retention period — destroying the audit trail.

4. **March 25, 2022 (Block 4,361,724):** 13,333,334 CERE sent from Company Wallet A to the fake wallet.
   **May 10, 2022 (Block 5,019,196):** 20,000,000 CERE sent from Company Wallet B to the same fake wallet.

5. **Within ~8 hours:** Entire 33,333,334 CERE drained to intermediary wallet using a test-then-sweep pattern (2 CERE test → 3.3M → 30M → 1 CERE dust). The intermediary then returned all tokens to Company Wallet A — **completing a full circle.** Vivian received nothing.

6. **January 6–7, 2024:** The stolen tokens were bridged **Cere mainnet → Polygon → Ethereum**, landing in bridge wallet `0xb08f79488D335FBc7E0881c78ba341dA1f249f00`:
   - Jan 6: 33,333 CERE (test) — [Tx: 0xd8f9cb...](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd8f9cbad8707da962ead135095d16dfa348f88285d90eae920997d03048f887e)
   - Jan 7: 33,299,997.97 CERE (full) — [Tx: 0x7e4fd0...](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7e4fd0db67af9dd1d080c54e188f478ff5c4d6ebdae08330adc261c2827b2ee1)

7. **Same days:** All 33,333,330.97 CERE sold on **KuCoin** (non-US exchange):
   - Jan 6: 33,333 CERE → KuCoin — [Tx: 0xcfe4dc...](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcfe4dca149d7128840cf62b606b808baa560be374ea0f9ddeddf04c140c5dd4e)
   - Jan 7: 33,299,997.97 CERE → KuCoin — [Tx: 0x0e2d9f...](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0e2d9f4695785148052c6ccda460c29392cc87aafc2db66abb2acdacccc4cf08)

8. **The AU21 Capital fingerprint:** Three days after the CERE cash-out, the **same bridge wallet** received:
   - 30,600,560.93 **RAZE** tokens from Gate.io — [Tx: 0x5b3f8d...](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5b3f8dba3138a639594014fb37ed596e95fe2af217316c84e4dd04352dc49aeb)
   - 5,376,609.47 **SKYRIM** tokens from Gate.io — [Tx: 0xc110c4...](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc110c4b5cb7565a65bd102a24e5acf1c40d807da998a4f61c9073151e381d5d6)

   Both RAZE and SKYRIM are **AU21 Capital portfolio companies** (Kenzi's fund). This creates a unique digital fingerprint that can only belong to Kenzi Wang.

9. **Direct funding from Kenzi's identified wallet:** The bridge wallet was funded with ETH gas by wallet `0x0d0707963952f2fba59dd06f2b425ace40b492fe` (labeled "Gate.io 1" on Etherscan), which also holds 276M CERE + #1 SKYRIM holder (38.26% of supply) + #1 RAZE holder (16.82% of supply). Gate.io subpoena will confirm the account holder.

10. **Bridge wallet now fully drained:** Balance $0.04 as of February 2026. All proceeds extracted.

**The "ringleader" allegation is projection** — Kenzi Wang accused Fred Jin of exactly what he himself did. This is textbook DARVO, consistent with his pattern across every venture (documented by multiple independent victims).

#### Evidence References
- Practus LLP investigation report (March–July 2024) — cleared Fred Jin
- DHTY forensic audit — confirmed Kenzi's fund diversions

### ALLEGATION 2

> *"Jin repeatedly promised insiders and early investors could not sell their tokens, which would be unlocked on a vesting schedule. But Jin and accomplices secretly sold over $41 million in Cere Tokens."*

**VERDICT: FALSE / MISLEADING**

#### Rebuttal

**A. Token Distribution Was Legitimate and Successful**

Cere Network conducted a properly structured token sale and distribution:

- **5,000+ Republic platform investors** received their tokens through proper vesting schedules.
- **160+ private investors** received their tokens through proper vesting schedules.
- **Standard distribution process:**
  1. Martijn Broersma obtained each investor's wallet address directly from the investor.
  2. Address shared with operations team (AK or AN) for entry into distribution mastersheet.
  3. Token transfers executed via Fireblocks (multi-signature authorization).
- **Every single investor** received their tokens through this process — **except Vivian Liu**, the one investor where Kenzi Wang inserted himself as sole intermediary.

**B. The "$41 Million" Figure Is Fabricated / Part of Kenzi's Narrative**

The $41 million allegation originates from Kenzi Wang's counter-narrative. The Practus LLP investigation and DHTY forensic audit found:

- **No evidence** of Fred Jin secretly selling tokens.
- The actual fund diversion was committed by **Kenzi Wang**: $4,817,900 diverted to personal wallets and wallets outside company control.
- The breakdown of Kenzi's theft:
  - $2,671,400 USDC — Private funds held in Kenzi's Binance custody (Jan 19, 2021)
  - $320,000 USDC — Additional funds raised, part of "black swan" admission (Jan 27, 2021)
  - $1,382,000 USDC — Funds in unapproved wallets (Apr 8, 2023)
  - $444,500 USDC — Shadow admin gap (May 9, 2023)
- Kenzi himself acknowledged a ~$3M loss in what he called a "black swan event." The forensic audit then uncovered an additional ~$1.7M in previously undisclosed diversions.
- Kenzi directed **75+ token purchasers** to send payment to wallets **he personally controlled** instead of official Cere company wallets.
- $14,426,850 flowed through funding rounds Kenzi touched; $4,423,400 ended up outside company control.
- Kenzi maintained a separate **"Token Sale Tracker"** spreadsheet, then **revoked company access** when the investigation began — destroying evidence.

**C. Kenzi's Delaware Complaint Is the Source**

Kenzi filed *Wang v. Cerebellum Network et al.* in Delaware Court of Chancery claiming $58M was diverted. The Practus investigation found **zero evidence** supporting these claims and identified **Kenzi as the perpetrator** — not the victim.

**D. Vivian Liu Was the ONLY Exception**

The strongest evidence that the token distribution was legitimate: **Vivian Liu is the sole investor out of 5,160+ who did not receive her tokens.** The sole variable in her case was Kenzi Wang's exclusive intermediation.

#### Evidence References
- Republic offering page — showing 5,000+ investors
- Distribution mastersheet — showing 160+ private investors received tokens
- Practus LLP investigation report — finding no evidence against Fred Jin
- DHTY forensic audit — confirming $4.8M in Kenzi's diversions
- Rocky Lee email / Board Memo (Nov 13, 2025) — damage quantification
- Kenzi's "black swan" admission

---

### ALLEGATION 3

> *"Cerebellum Network Inc. (DE) and Interdata Network Ltd. (BVI) were or are shell companies that did not exist during the relevant time period."*

**VERDICT: FALSE**

#### Rebuttal

Both entities are **real, operating companies** with documented histories, employees, bank accounts, and contractual relationships.

*See Section 3 below for detailed entity verification.*

---

### ALLEGATION 4

> *"Jin made numerous misrepresentations and false promises to lure early investors, raising over $42 million for Cere Network. Jin later siphoned about $16.6 million in investor funds originally slated for Cere Network's operations. Jin moved these stolen funds into shell companies and accounts controlled by him and his accomplices, and he also gambled away millions of dollars in risky crypto trades."*

**VERDICT: FALSE / MISLEADING**

#### Rebuttal

**A. The $42 Million Was Raised Legitimately**

Cere Network raised approximately $42.9 million through legitimate fundraising channels, including private token sales to institutional and accredited investors, and a public offering on Republic.com. These funds were raised through standard venture/crypto fundraising processes with proper documentation, investor agreements, and regulatory compliance (including Reg D for US investors via Republic). Over 5,000 Republic investors and 160+ private investors participated. This fundraise was not a "lure" — it was a properly structured capital raise for a technology company building blockchain data infrastructure.

**B. The "$16.6 Million Siphoned" Claim Is False**

The Practus LLP investigation (March–July 2024) and DHTY forensic audit specifically investigated fund flows and found:

- **No evidence of Fred Jin siphoning funds.** The investigation explicitly concluded: *"No evidence to support Wang's allegations regarding Fred Jin's misappropriation of Company funds."*
- The **actual fund diversion** was committed by **Kenzi Wang** — $4,817,900 confirmed diverted to personal wallets and wallets outside company control (see Allegation 1 rebuttal for full breakdown).
- The $16.6 million figure appears to be fabricated by the complaint's drafters (i.e., Kenzi Wang's narrative). It does not correspond to any figure in the forensic audit or internal investigation.
- Legitimate operational expenditures — payroll, engineering, infrastructure, marketing, legal, exchange listings, market making — are standard business expenses for a technology company that raised $42.9M. Spending raised capital on operations is not "siphoning."

**C. "Shell Companies and Accounts" — See Allegation 3 and Section 3**

The entities named in the complaint (Cerebellum Network Inc., Interdata Network Ltd., CEF AI Inc., etc.) are real operating companies with employees, bank accounts, contracts, and active litigation history. See the detailed entity verification in Section 3 and Allegation 10 below.

**D. "Gambled Away Millions in Risky Crypto Trades" — Unsupported and Misleading**

- The complaint provides no evidence for this allegation.
- Managing a crypto project's treasury involves holding and transacting in cryptocurrency — this is inherent to the business model, not "gambling."
- Any treasury management activities would have been in the ordinary course of business for a blockchain company.
- The forensic audit by DHTY traced actual fund flows; it identified **Kenzi Wang's** diversions, not speculative trading losses by Fred Jin.
- To the extent any "black swan" losses occurred, Kenzi Wang himself acknowledged a ~$3M "black swan event" — this was **Kenzi's** loss of funds he held in his own Binance custody, not Fred Jin's trading.

#### Evidence References
- Practus LLP investigation report — cleared Fred Jin of all fund misappropriation claims
- DHTY forensic audit — traced $4.8M to Kenzi's wallets, no evidence of Jin siphoning
- Republic offering documentation — showing legitimate fundraise structure
- Kenzi's "black swan" admission — acknowledging his own $3M loss
- Board committee report (Nov 2025) — comprehensive damage analysis

---

### ALLEGATION 5

> *"Jin worked with a company convicted of market manipulation, Gotbit, which employed sophisticated internet bots to make it appear that more Cere Tokens were being traded. Jin manipulated the trading volume and engaged in wash trading, designed to conceal the fraud and mask Jin's brazen theft of millions of dollars."*

**VERDICT: MISLEADING — CONFLATES STANDARD INDUSTRY PRACTICE WITH FRAUD**

#### Rebuttal

**A. Market Making Is Standard Practice in the Cryptocurrency Industry**

Engaging a market maker is **standard, legal, and expected practice** for any token project listing on exchanges. Market makers provide:
- **Liquidity** — ensuring investors can buy and sell tokens without excessive price impact
- **Orderly markets** — reducing bid-ask spreads
- **Exchange listing requirements** — many exchanges require proof of liquidity/market making as a condition of listing

Virtually every legitimate token project — including those backed by top-tier VCs like a16z, Paradigm, and Sequoia — engages market makers. This is not illegal, not unusual, and not evidence of fraud. The SEC has distinguished between legitimate market making and illegal wash trading; the former is a lawful service.

**B. The Gotbit Situation Requires Context**

- If Cere Network engaged Gotbit or any market maker, it would have been for **legitimate liquidity provision** — a standard business practice in the industry.
- Gotbit's subsequent legal issues relate to Gotbit's own conduct and business practices with other clients. A company hiring a service provider that later faces legal trouble does not make the hiring company complicit in unrelated misconduct.
- The complaint provides **no specific evidence** that Cere Network directed, authorized, or was aware of any wash trading. Engaging a market maker to provide liquidity is categorically different from directing that market maker to engage in wash trading.
- **Analogy:** A company that hires an accounting firm that later faces fraud charges is not automatically guilty of accounting fraud. The question is what services were contracted and what the client knew.

**C. "Designed to Conceal the Fraud" — Unsupported Conclusory Statement**

- The complaint provides no evidence connecting market making to any alleged concealment.
- Market making is done to facilitate trading, not to "conceal fraud."
- This allegation conflates two unrelated concepts: (1) legitimate liquidity provision and (2) the complaint's unproven fraud narrative.

**D. The Real Market Manipulation: Kenzi Wang's $ELE Pump-and-Dump**

Ironically, the person behind this complaint — Kenzi Wang — was himself implicated in an **actual pump-and-dump scheme**: the $ELE (Elecoin) meme coin scandal (May 2024). In that scheme:
- Kenzi authorized domain access for the project website
- Insiders controlled most of the supply
- KOLs were gathered in Telegram to promote the token
- Market cap crashed from $17M to $2M as insiders dumped
- Developers and KOLs were promised USDC but never paid
- **ZachXBT** (crypto's most respected fraud investigator) publicly flagged Kenzi for "threatening and abusing founders"

**Sources:** AiCoin exposé, ChainCatcher, Bitget News, DailyCoin, ZachXBT tweet (Jan 2022)

#### Evidence References
- Industry standards for market making (any major exchange's listing requirements)
- $ELE meme coin exposé (AiCoin, ChainCatcher, Bitget News, May 2024) — Kenzi's actual pump-and-dump
- ZachXBT tweet re: Kenzi Wang (January 2022)
- Note for counsel: Obtain and review the specific market making agreement to confirm scope of services contracted

---

### ALLEGATION 6

> *"This insider dump caused the Cere Token's price to plummet by over 99%, wiping out the value of the venture and the holdings of its investors. Upon discovering the undisclosed token dumps and other misconduct, every independent advisor resigned between April and May 2023. Plaintiffs relied on Defendants' assurances that Cere was already profitable, had Fortune-1000 enterprise contracts, and was on the verge of launching — representations that they knew were false and misleading. Jin's conduct with Cere reflects a pattern of fraud: launching ventures, raising funds on inflated claims, and then quietly abandoning them for the next project. Plaintiffs would later learn that Jin had launched Funler (mobile gaming company) in 2015, Bitlearn (education-blockchain platform) in 2017, and Cere Network (data storage and crypto) in 2019, CEF AI (artificial intelligence) in 2024. Each time, Jin abandoned investors when the business became difficult."*

**VERDICT: FALSE / MISLEADING — MULTIPLE DISCRETE CLAIMS, ALL FLAWED**

#### Rebuttal

**A. The 99% Price Drop — Industry-Wide Bear Market, Not Cere-Specific**

The complaint presents the 99% price decline as evidence of fraud. This is profoundly misleading:

- **The entire cryptocurrency market experienced a catastrophic downturn in 2022–2023.** Bitcoin fell from ~$69,000 (Nov 2021) to ~$16,000 (Nov 2022) — a **77% decline**. Ethereum fell from ~$4,800 to ~$880 — an **82% decline**.
- **Hundreds of legitimate, VC-backed projects** experienced 90–99%+ declines during this period, including projects backed by the most reputable investors in the industry.
- CERE's price trajectory was consistent with the broader market — not evidence of fraud.
- The complaint's own source (CoinDesk article) notes Cere launched at ~$0.45 and fell to $0.06 "within weeks" — this was during a period when the **entire crypto market was collapsing**.
- If a 99% decline proves fraud, then virtually every token launched in 2021 was fraudulent — an absurd proposition.

**B. "Every Independent Advisor Resigned" — Context: Kenzi's Narrative Poisoning**

- If advisors resigned in April–May 2023, this timing is critical: **May 19, 2023 is when Cere filed its complaint against Kenzi Wang** for $1.3M theft. Kenzi was actively engaged in evidence destruction (revoking access to the Token Sale Tracker), social media hijacking (seizing Cere's Twitter and Telegram), and disseminating his counter-narrative.
- Advisor departures during this period are more consistent with **Kenzi's destabilization campaign** than with discovery of fraud by Fred Jin.
- Kenzi's documented pattern includes using intimidation, threatening letters (via Singapore law firms), doxxing, and retaliatory narratives to create chaos and force departures. Multiple independent victims have described this exact playbook.
- **The question is not whether advisors left, but why.** If advisors left because of Kenzi's narrative, that supports our case, not the plaintiff's.
- Note for counsel: Determine which advisors resigned and interview them about what information they received (and from whom) prior to resignation.

**C. "Fortune-1000 Enterprise Contracts" / "Already Profitable" — Requires Factual Review**

- Claims about Fortune-1000 contracts and profitability need to be reviewed against actual marketing materials and investor communications.
- Startup companies routinely discuss pipeline, pilot programs, and anticipated partnerships in fundraising materials. There is a distinction between forward-looking statements (common and lawful) and deliberate misrepresentation (fraud).
- The complaint provides no specific evidence of which representations were made, when, by whom, and to whom — it makes conclusory allegations without factual support.
- Note for counsel: Review all investor-facing materials, pitch decks, and communications to assess what was actually represented.

**D. "Pattern of Fraud" (Funler → Bitlearn → Cere → CEF AI) — This Is Serial Entrepreneurship, Not Serial Fraud**

The complaint's attempt to paint Fred Jin as a serial fraudster because he founded multiple companies is absurd on its face:

- **Serial entrepreneurship is the norm in Silicon Valley and the tech industry**, not evidence of fraud. Founders routinely launch multiple ventures over their careers. Failure is expected — the vast majority of startups fail.
- **Funler (2015)** — A mobile gaming company. Launching a gaming startup that doesn't succeed is not fraud.
- **Bitlearn (2017)** — An education-blockchain platform. **Notably, the Bitlearn Medium article (April 2018) reveals Kenzi Wang himself joined Bitlearn's advisory board, and Fred Jin was CEO.** This means Kenzi and Fred had a working relationship **before** Cere — Kenzi knew Fred, trusted him, and joined his project. If Bitlearn were a "fraud," why would Kenzi voluntarily associate himself with it?
- **Cere Network (2019)** — A legitimate technology company that raised $42.9M, built real technology, employed real engineers, and distributed tokens to 5,160+ investors. The fraud at Cere was committed by **Kenzi Wang**, not Fred Jin.
- **CEF AI (2024)** — A legitimate AI venture. Launching a new company after a prior venture is exactly what entrepreneurs do.
- **The actual serial fraudster is Kenzi Wang**, with a documented trail spanning:
  - Buzzstarter/Traction Labs (marketplace vanished ~2015, fabricated "acquisition")
  - SuperBloom/SEED (dead — BitcoinTalk scam warning, co-founder called him "Tinder Swindler")
  - HBUS/Huobi US (ceased operations Dec 2019 under his watch)
  - AU21 Capital portfolio destruction (VegaSwap: total loss; Youclout: 99.8% loss; AvaXlauncher: 97% loss; Dragon Kart: 99.1% loss)
  - Cere Network ($4.8M diverted + 33.3M tokens stolen)
  - $ELE meme coin (crashed $17M → $2M)
  - Grand Theft charge (2018, Case No. 18017577)
  - 7+ fund entities created over ~8 years to distance from prior failures

**E. "Quietly Abandoning" — Jin Did Not Abandon Cere**

- Fred Jin remained at Cere Network and continued building the company.
- It was **Kenzi Wang** who departed (mid-2022) — and then launched a sabotage campaign after leaving.
- Fred Jin is actively defending the company, coordinating legal strategy, and participating in the counterclaim — the opposite of "abandonment."

#### Evidence References
- CoinMarketCap / CoinGecko — Bitcoin and Ethereum price history showing market-wide collapse
- Cere v. Wang complaint (May 19, 2023) — timing aligns with advisor departures
- Kenzi's social media hijacking — Dubai Criminal Case 33359/2025

### ALLEGATION 7 (RICO Enterprise & Conspiracy)

> *Various claims about RICO enterprise, fraud, and conspiracy among named defendants.*

**VERDICT: FALSE — ORCHESTRATED BY THE ACTUAL PERPETRATOR**

#### Rebuttal

**A. The Lawsuit Was Orchestrated by Kenzi Wang**

Assessment from the February 2, 2026 litigation strategy call (participants: Fred Jin, Jenny, Matt Miller, Rocky Lee, Martijn Broersma):

- **Kenzi is 100% behind this lawsuit.** He stole Vivian's tokens AND directed her to sue Cere.
- The lawsuit was filed by a **small Los Angeles plaintiff firm** (5 attorneys, 2 partners, 3 associates) — likely retained by Kenzi's network.
- The complaint mirrors Kenzi's narrative from his Delaware Chancery suit.
- CoinDesk published a one-sided article (*"Investors accuse Cere Network of $100M fraud"*) on January 29, 2026 — part of a coordinated media strategy.
- The complaint had **NOT been served** as of February 2, 2026.

**B. Kenzi's Modus Operandi — Documented Pattern**

Multiple independent victims describe the same pattern:

> *"Tell a big story, get you to sign an agreement, then starts exhausting your positive energy and ultimately shakes you down."* — **Vijay Garg**, Inclusion Capital

> *"[Kenzi Wang is] the white-collar crypto version of the Tinder Swindler."* — **Emmie Chang**, former SuperBloom co-founder

> *"Everyone knows Kenzi is awful."* — **Emmie Chang**

> *"A whole Telegram group of people wronged by Kenzi Wang."* — Confidential source

**C. The "Booby Trap" Structure**

Kenzi planted the fake wallet while still at Cere (late 2021–early 2022). He knew Vivian was pregnant and hard to reach. The tokens were claimed/moved **after** he left the company. When Vivian eventually noticed missing tokens, Kenzi directed her to sue Cere — turning the victim into a weapon against the company he defrauded.

**D. Martijn's Direct Contact with Vivian (November 14, 2023)**

- Martijn emailed Vivian and Kevin: *"Hey Vivian, Kevin. Looking at the records, all transactions have been completed."*
- Kevin responded November 15, claimed they never provided a mainnet wallet, requested a call.
- Kevin booked a Calendly appointment for Monday — didn't show.
- Said he could do Saturday — **then complete silence.** Never heard from again.
- This is consistent with Kenzi directing Vivian/Kevin to stop responding once Cere started asking questions.

#### Evidence References
- February 2, 2026 litigation strategy call notes
- Email exchange with Vivian/Kevin (November 14–15, 2023)
- PI reports — victim pattern documentation
- ZachXBT tweet (Jan 2022) — calling out Kenzi for "threatening and abusing founders"
- $ELE meme coin scandal coverage (May 2024)

### ALLEGATION 8 (Regarding Advisory Agreement)

> *Vivian Liu claims she performed "several hundred hours" of advisory work.*

**VERDICT: FALSE / UNSUPPORTED**

#### Rebuttal

- A Strategic Advisory Agreement was signed by "Lujunjin Liu" (Vivian's legal name) for 20,000,000 CERE tokens.
- **Actual work performed:** Only 1–2 calls with the company, then disappeared.
- **Invoices submitted:** Zero.
- **Demand for advisory tokens:** Never made.
- **Company awareness of work:** None — Kenzi was the sole conduit. If any work was done, it was only communicated to Kenzi.
- **"Several hundred hours" claim:** The company was never informed of any such work. No work product exists. No invoices exist.

#### Evidence References
- Strategic Advisory Agreement (signatory: "Lujunjin Liu")
- Internal communications — no record of advisory work
- Absence of invoices

---

### ALLEGATION 9 (Regarding Other Named Individual Defendants — Brad Bell/Bao, Francois Grenade)

> *Brad Bell/Bao and Francois Grenade are alleged co-conspirators.*

**VERDICT: FALSE**

#### Rebuttal

- **Brad Bell/Bao, Francois Grenade** — Named as defendants but no specific evidence of wrongdoing presented in the complaint beyond guilt-by-association with Cere Network operations. The complaint provides no particularized allegations of what fraudulent acts these individuals personally committed.

**Legal Strategy (from Feb 2 call):** Individual defendants will **NOT waive service** — the hope is they are never properly served.

---

### ALLEGATION 10

> *"Jin is an individual and citizen of California, resident of San Francisco. Jin is the head of the fraudulent scheme. He is a co-founder and served as the CEO of the Cere Network. The Cere Network is the name of Jin's technology and cryptocurrency venture that was, in reality, a classic example of pump and dump crypto fraud scheme. The scheme was perpetrated by Jin and his co-conspirators and associates—which include Jin's family members, close associates, and various foreign and U.S.-based companies under their control. These companies included Cere Network, Ltd., Interdata Network Ltd., Cerebellum Network Inc., Opendata Network Foundation, Cere Holding AG, BNW Network GmbH, Cere Network DAO, and CEF AI Inc. All of these companies have been and/or continue to be operated and controlled by Jin and his co-conspirators. Although other individuals may be listed as managing agents or executives on corporate documents, Plaintiffs understand and believe that they all report and answer to Jin."*

**VERDICT: FALSE — STANDARD CORPORATE STRUCTURE MISCHARACTERIZED AS CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE**

#### Rebuttal

**A. The Entity Structure Is Standard for International Blockchain Projects**

The complaint lists eight entities and implies they are shell companies in a criminal enterprise. In reality, this is a **standard multi-jurisdictional corporate structure** used by virtually every international blockchain/crypto project of Cere's scale:

| Entity | Jurisdiction | Actual Purpose | Shell Company? |
|--------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Cerebellum Network Inc.** | Delaware, USA | Primary US operating entity — employees, bank accounts, filed federal lawsuits, Republic offering entity | **NO** — active operating company |
| **Interdata Network Ltd.** | BVI | International operations — party to investor agreements, named plaintiff in active federal litigation (3:25-cv-03798) | **NO** — actively litigating in US federal court |
| **CEF AI Inc.** | Delaware, USA | AI-focused venture entity | **NO** — active entity |
| **Cere Network, Ltd.** | Likely BVI/Cayman | Token-related entity — standard for token issuance structure | Standard industry practice |
| **Opendata Network Foundation** | Likely Switzerland/Liechtenstein | Foundation structure — standard for decentralized protocol governance | Industry standard (e.g., Ethereum Foundation, Polkadot/Web3 Foundation, Cardano Foundation) |
| **Cere Holding AG** | Switzerland (AG = Aktiengesellschaft) | Swiss holding company — common for European operations and banking | Standard international corporate structure |
| **BNW Network GmbH** | Germany (GmbH) | German operating entity — likely for EU operations, employment, or R&D | Standard for EU operations |
| **Cere Network DAO** | Decentralized | Decentralized autonomous organization — standard for protocol governance | Industry standard (e.g., MakerDAO, Uniswap DAO, Aave DAO) |

**Why multiple entities?** International blockchain projects routinely use multi-entity structures because:
1. **Regulatory compliance** — Different jurisdictions have different crypto regulations. US entities for US investors/employees, Swiss/EU entities for European operations, BVI/Cayman for token issuance.
2. **Banking access** — Crypto companies often need banking relationships in multiple jurisdictions. Swiss AG entities provide access to Swiss banking; German GmbH entities provide access to EU banking.
3. **Tax efficiency** — Standard international corporate tax planning, used by every multinational company.
4. **Token issuance** — Token generation events are typically conducted through non-US entities for regulatory reasons (avoiding US securities law issues). This is standard legal advice from every major crypto law firm.
5. **Foundation governance** — Decentralized protocols use foundation structures (Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Cayman, Singapore) to manage protocol development and grants. Ethereum, Polkadot, Cardano, Solana, and virtually every major protocol uses this structure.

**B. "All Report and Answer to Jin" — That's Called Being CEO**

The complaint's assertion that employees and managers "all report and answer to Jin" is presented as sinister. This is simply **how companies work**:
- Fred Jin was the **CEO**. In every corporation, employees report to the CEO.
- Having a hierarchical management structure is not evidence of fraud — it is evidence of a functioning company.
- The same could be said about any CEO of any company: "All employees report and answer to [CEO]." This is a tautology, not an allegation.

**C. "Co-Conspirators" Including "Family Members"**

- The complaint names **Xin Jin** as a defendant and implies family relationships constitute conspiracy.
- Family members working at or investing in a startup is **extremely common** in entrepreneurship, particularly in immigrant and first-generation communities. It is not evidence of fraud.
- The complaint provides no specific allegations of what role any "family member" played in any alleged wrongdoing.

**D. Comparison: Kenzi Wang's Actual Shell Company / Entity Layering**

While the complaint accuses Cere of using shell companies, the actual perpetrator — Kenzi Wang — has created **7+ fund entities** over approximately 8 years, including renaming entities to obscure their history:

| Entity | Years | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Sparkland Capital | Pre-2017 | Unknown status |
| F50 | Pre-2017 | Unknown status |
| AU21 Capital | 2017–present | Co-founded with Chandler Guo (Gate.io co-founder) |
| Borderless Capital | 2020–2022 | Venture Partner role |
| Hyperedge Capital | ~2021 | **Renamed to Symbolic Capital** — confirmed via Crunchbase URL |
| Symbolic Capital | 2022–present | $50M fund with Sandeep Nailwal |
| Sensys | 2024–present | Vehicle for Sentient "core contributor" role |

Kenzi repeatedly creates new entities to:
- Distance himself from prior failures and fraud allegations
- Access new deal flow and investor capital
- Obscure the trail from one venture to the next

**This is the actual "shell company" pattern — and it belongs to Kenzi Wang, not Fred Jin.**

#### Evidence References
- Standard blockchain project structures — compare Ethereum Foundation, Polkadot/Web3 Foundation, Cardano Foundation, Solana Foundation
- Crunchbase URL for Symbolic Capital (`crunchbase.com/organization/hyperedge-capital`) — confirming Hyperedge → Symbolic rename
- Kenzi's entity timeline — 7+ fund entities documented across research files
- Republic offering page — showing Cerebellum Network Inc. as legitimate offering entity

### ALLEGATION 11 (Maren Schwarzer)

> *"Schwarzer is Jin's wife, and the money mover in the fraudulent scheme. Served as sole director of BNW Network GmbH. Helped form and run shell/affiliate entities, received/held proceeds, opened bank/exchange accounts, issued back-dated invoices, created sham services to justify transfers, served as signatory moving crypto assets across borders. Through BNW Network and personal crypto exchange account, received ill-gotten funds used to pay for luxury real estate in Germany and Florida. Worked with Xin Jin to route millions through Interdata Network Ltd into European bank accounts. BNW Network was used to mask origin and ultimate beneficiaries. Was a signer for Cere Network token treasuries. Signed off on illicit transactions including $16.6M from public sale and $41.78M in token sales."*

**VERDICT: FALSE / GROSSLY MISLEADING — ROUTINE CORPORATE OPERATIONS RECHARACTERIZED AS FRAUD**

#### Rebuttal

**A. BNW Network GmbH Is a Legitimate German Operating Entity — Not a "Shell"**

- BNW Network GmbH is a **German limited liability company** (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung). GmbH entities are the standard corporate form for business operations in Germany, subject to German commercial law, corporate governance requirements, annual audit requirements, and tax reporting obligations.
- Having a director of a German subsidiary is **routine corporate governance**, not evidence of a criminal scheme. Every GmbH is required by German law to have a Geschäftsführer (managing director).
- BNW Network operated as Cere's European operational entity — handling EU employment, R&D, banking, and compliance. International technology companies routinely have EU subsidiaries for exactly these purposes.

**B. "Opened Bank/Exchange Accounts" — Standard Corporate Treasury Operations**

- A crypto company's operations **require** exchange accounts and bank accounts. Tokens must be held, traded, and distributed. Fiat currency must be received from investors and used to pay salaries, vendors, and operational expenses.
- Opening bank and exchange accounts on behalf of a company is what **every finance/operations person at every company does**. This is not evidence of money laundering — it is evidence of a functioning business.
- The complaint conflates standard corporate finance activity with criminal conduct.

**C. "Back-Dated Invoices" / "Sham Services" — Conclusory Allegation Without Evidence**

- The complaint provides **no specific evidence** of any back-dated invoice or sham service. It makes a conclusory allegation without identifying any particular invoice, date, amount, or service.
- Note for counsel: If any specific invoices are identified in discovery, review them to determine whether services were legitimately rendered.

**D. "Luxury Real Estate in Germany and Florida" — Irrelevant Without Fraud Nexus**

- Purchasing real estate with legitimately earned compensation is not evidence of fraud.
- The complaint does not establish that any real estate purchase was funded with "ill-gotten" funds. It assumes the conclusion (fraud occurred) and then uses property ownership as "evidence" of that assumed conclusion. This is circular reasoning.

**E. "Signed Off on $16.6M and $41.78M" — Recycled Dollar Figures Without Evidentiary Basis**

- The complaint attributes the **same $41.78M figure to every defendant** (see Allegations 12 and 13 below). This is a rhetorical device, not evidence — it implies each defendant independently stole the same $41.78M, which is mathematically and logically impossible.
- The $16.6M and $41.78M figures do not correspond to any finding in the Practus LLP investigation or DHTY forensic audit. They appear to originate from Kenzi Wang's fabricated narrative.
- Being a **co-signer on token treasury transactions** is a standard control function in crypto companies using multi-signature wallets. The purpose of multi-sig is precisely to ensure that no single individual can unilaterally move funds. Co-signing legitimate distributions to 5,160+ investors is normal operations.

**F. "Routing Millions Through Interdata" — Standard Inter-Company Fund Flows**

- Moving funds between affiliated entities (e.g., from Interdata Network to BNW Network GmbH) is standard inter-company treasury management. This is how every multinational corporation operates — funds flow between parent, subsidiary, and affiliate entities in the ordinary course of business.
- The complaint provides no evidence that any inter-company transfer was illegitimate. It simply describes standard corporate fund flows and labels them as money laundering.

#### Evidence References
- BNW Network GmbH — German commercial registry records (Handelsregister)
- Standard multi-entity corporate treasury operations — industry practice
- Practus LLP investigation — did not find evidence of Maren Schwarzer involvement in any fraud
- DHTY forensic audit — traced fund diversions to Kenzi Wang, not Maren Schwarzer

---

### ALLEGATION 12 (Xin Jin)

> *"Jin's brother. Worked in operations for Cere Network. Generated and held keys needed to move crypto tokens, transferred tokens from company treasury, coordinated with a market maker. Received and transferred substantial funds, helped conceal true source/destination. Created plans to incorporate multiple entities to evade taxes. Signatory for token treasuries. Signed off on illicit transactions including $16.6M from Republic public sale and $41.78M in token sales."*

**VERDICT: FALSE / MISLEADING — ROUTINE OPERATIONS ROLE MISCHARACTERIZED**

#### Rebuttal

**A. "Generated and Held Keys" — Standard Multi-Signature Custody Role**

- Crypto companies use **multi-signature (multi-sig) wallets** specifically so that no single person can unilaterally move funds. Multiple key holders must approve transactions. Holding one of several keys is a **security function**, not evidence of theft.
- Being a key holder for token distributions to 5,160+ investors is an operations role. The tokens were distributed to thousands of investors successfully — this is evidence the system worked as designed.

**B. "Coordinated with a Market Maker" — Standard Business Function**

- Coordinating with market makers is a routine business function for any token project. Market makers provide liquidity and are required by exchanges as a condition of listing (see Allegation 5 rebuttal).
- The complaint provides no evidence that any coordination with a market maker involved illegal activity.

**C. "Created Plans to Incorporate Multiple Entities to Evade Taxes" — Conclusory and Misleading**

- International corporate structuring for tax efficiency is **legal and standard**. Every multinational company (Apple, Google, Amazon, etc.) uses multi-jurisdictional structures for tax planning.
- Tax planning ≠ tax evasion. The complaint conflates the two without providing any evidence that taxes were actually evaded.
- The complaint provides no specific evidence of any tax evasion — no unpaid tax bills, no IRS correspondence, no tax deficiency notices.

**D. Same $16.6M and $41.78M Figures — Recycled Across Every Defendant**

- As with Maren Schwarzer, the complaint attributes the **identical dollar amounts** to Xin Jin. The same $41.78M cannot have been independently stolen by every defendant — the complaint is using the same figure for rhetorical effect, not as evidence of individual wrongdoing.
- These figures do not correspond to any finding in the independent forensic audit.

**E. "Helped Conceal True Source/Destination" — No Evidence Provided**

- The complaint provides no specific evidence of concealment. It describes routine multi-sig operations (transferring tokens, holding keys) and labels them as concealment.
- The Practus LLP investigation and DHTY forensic audit identified **Kenzi Wang** as the person who concealed fund flows — not Xin Jin.

#### Evidence References
- Multi-signature custody operations — industry standard (Fireblocks, Gnosis Safe, etc.)
- Practus LLP investigation — did not identify Xin Jin as involved in any fraud
- DHTY forensic audit — traced fund diversions to Kenzi Wang

### ⚠️ ALLEGATION 13 (Martijn Broersma — CRITICAL: OUR PRINCIPAL)

> *"CMO of Cere Network. Reported to Jin. Helped promote Cere's decentralized structure and boasted of Fortune 500 clients. At Jin's behest, made knowingly false representations about Cere Network's technological capabilities and client roster with revenue and profitability which the company never had. Threatened and intimidated former employees and investors who complained. Signed off on many illicit transactions including $12 million from public sale and $41.78 million in token sales."*

**VERDICT: FALSE — EVERY MATERIAL CLAIM IS WRONG OR FABRICATED**

#### Rebuttal

This allegation is the most thoroughly rebutted because Martijn Broersma is our principal defendant. Every material claim in this paragraph is either factually wrong, unsupported, or the direct opposite of the truth.

---

**A. "CMO of Cere Network" — FALSE: MART WAS NEVER CMO**

Martijn Broersma was **never** the Chief Marketing Officer of Cere Network. His actual role was **operations and administration**, encompassing:

- **Token distribution logistics** — entering wallet addresses into distribution spreadsheets (Google Sheets), coordinating with the operations team (AK, AN) to ensure investors received their tokens
- **Investor relations coordination** — collecting wallet addresses directly from investors, responding to investor inquiries
- **HR pipeline** — recruitment and personnel administration
- **General operations** — administrative coordination across the organization

He was **not** a C-suite executive. He was **not** in a strategic decision-making role regarding product claims, technology representations, or investor promises. The CMO title is fabricated by the complaint and does not appear in any corporate record, organizational chart, or official document.

On the Republic.com offering page, Martijn was listed without a specific executive title — **not** as CMO. Fred Jin was listed as "General Contributor" and Kenzi Wang was listed as "General Contributor."

---

**B. "Made Knowingly False Representations About Technological Capabilities and Client Roster" — FALSE: NOT HIS ROLE**

- Martijn Broersma is **not a technical person** in terms of core blockchain protocol engineering. He did not develop or represent Cere Network's technical architecture, product capabilities, or technology roadmap.
- Product claims, technology capabilities, partnership announcements, and enterprise client representations were made by the **CEO (Fred Jin)**, the **technical team**, and **official company communications** — not by an operations/admin coordinator.
- The complaint provides **no specific evidence** of any particular false representation made by Martijn personally — no quoted statement, no identified document, no dated communication. It makes a conclusory allegation without any factual predicate.
- **The actual misrepresentations** in the Cere ecosystem were made by **Kenzi Wang** — who fabricated credentials (fake a16z GP, fake hadron.cloud CEO, fake Traction Labs acquisition), created a paid Wikitia page with fabricated citations, and disseminated a false counter-narrative.

---

**C. "Threatened and Intimidated Former Employees and Investors" — FALSE: THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE**

This allegation is not merely unsupported — it is the **direct opposite of documented reality**.

**What actually happened:**

1. **November 14, 2023:** Martijn **proactively contacted Vivian Liu** (the plaintiff in this lawsuit) by email to help resolve her token situation: *"Hey Vivian, Kevin. Looking at the records, all transactions have been completed."* He provided wallet addresses and transaction details — trying to help.

2. **November 15, 2023:** Kevin (Vivian's associate) responded briefly, said they never provided a mainnet wallet, requested a call. Martijn accommodated.

3. **Kevin booked a Calendly appointment for Monday — didn't show.** Said he could do Saturday — **then complete silence.** Never heard from again.

4. **Martijn tried to help the very person who is now suing him.** This is the opposite of "threatening and intimidating."

**Who actually threatened and intimidated?** Kenzi Wang:
- Multiple independent victims report Kenzi uses **Singapore-based law firms** to send threatening letters to anyone who pushes back.
- Vijay Garg: *"He keeps doxxing you and saying 'I'm a cofounder, I have these rights, if you don't send me money I will go after you.'"*
- Emmie Chang was sued by Kenzi (LA County Case 18STCV05701).
- Domination Finance founders received threatening letters after confronting Kenzi.
- **ZachXBT** publicly flagged Kenzi for *"threatening and abusing founders."*

The complaint's allegation of "threatening and intimidating" is projection — it describes **Kenzi Wang's documented behavior** and falsely attributes it to Martijn.

---

**D. "Signed Off on Many Illicit Transactions Including $12 Million from Public Sale and $41.78 Million in Token Sales" — FALSE AND MISLEADING ON MULTIPLE LEVELS**

**1. Martijn was NOT a Fireblocks multi-sig signer.**

Token distributions were executed via **Fireblocks**, which required multi-signature authorization from specific key holders. Martijn Broersma was **not** one of those key holders. He did not have the cryptographic authority to approve or execute token transfers from the treasury.

His role in the distribution process was **administrative**:
- Collect wallet addresses from investors
- Enter addresses into the distribution mastersheet (Google Sheets)
- Coordinate with the operations team (AK, AN) who interfaced with Fireblocks

This is the equivalent of a payroll clerk entering employee bank account numbers into a spreadsheet — it is clerical work, not financial authorization.

**2. The $12M figure is presented without context.**

The Republic public sale raised funds from 5,000+ investors. Processing and distributing tokens to these investors required administrative coordination. Martijn's involvement in this process was **facilitating the proper distribution of tokens to legitimate investors** — not "signing off on illicit transactions."

**3. The $41.78M figure is attributed to EVERY defendant.**

The complaint uses the identical $41.78M figure for Maren Schwarzer (Allegation 11), Xin Jin (Allegation 12), and Martijn Broersma (Allegation 13). This is a drafting tactic — attributing the same aggregate number to every defendant to create the appearance of massive individual liability. It is not evidence of individual wrongdoing.

**4. The DHTY forensic audit traced diversions to Kenzi Wang — not to Martijn.**

The independent forensic audit identified $4,817,900 diverted to wallets controlled by or associated with Kenzi Wang. **Zero dollars** were traced to Martijn Broersma.

---

**E. Martijn's Compensation Is Inconsistent With Profiting From Fraud**

- Martijn's current salary is approximately **$150,000/year** — and started significantly lower.
- This is a **modest salary** for someone working in the blockchain industry, particularly for someone the complaint alleges participated in a "$100 million fraud."
- If Martijn were a co-conspirator profiting from tens of millions in stolen funds, his compensation and lifestyle would reflect it. They do not.
- The complaint does not allege that Martijn received any portion of the supposedly stolen funds beyond his employment compensation.

---

**F. The Practus LLP Investigation Found Martijn Credible**

The independent Practus LLP investigation (March–July 2024), which included interviews with all relevant parties, specifically found Martijn Broersma **credible** in his statements. The investigation:

- Did **not** identify Martijn as involved in any fund diversion or token theft
- Did **not** find evidence that Martijn made false representations
- Did **not** find evidence that Martijn threatened or intimidated anyone
- **Did** confirm Martijn's account of the distribution process and his contact with Vivian Liu

---

**G. Summary: What Martijn Actually Did vs. What the Complaint Alleges**

| Complaint Alleges | Reality |
|-------------------|---------|
| "CMO of Cere Network" | **Never CMO.** Operations/admin role — distribution logistics, HR, general ops |
| "Made knowingly false representations about technology and clients" | **Not his role.** Did not make product/technology claims. Not a technical person. |
| "Threatened and intimidated employees and investors" | **The opposite.** Proactively contacted Vivian on Nov 14, 2023 to help resolve her situation. She ghosted him. |
| "Signed off on $12M and $41.78M in illicit transactions" | **Not a Fireblocks signer.** Administrative role entering wallet addresses into spreadsheets. Same $41.78M attributed to every defendant. |
| (Implied) Profited from fraud | **$150K salary.** No evidence of receiving stolen funds. |
| (Implied) Part of conspiracy | **Found credible** by independent Practus LLP investigation. Identified Kenzi Wang as perpetrator. |

#### Evidence References
- Practus LLP investigation report — found Martijn credible; no evidence of wrongdoing
- DHTY forensic audit — traced diversions to Kenzi Wang, $0 to Martijn
- Republic offering page — Martijn listed without CMO title
- Email to Vivian Liu (November 14, 2023) — Martijn proactively reaching out to help
- Kevin response and ghosting (November 15, 2023) — Mart trying to resolve; plaintiff side going silent
- Martijn's employment records — compensation history
- Fireblocks access controls — multi-sig key holder list (Martijn not included)
- Distribution mastersheet — showing Martijn's administrative role (data entry, not authorization)
- PI reports — documenting Kenzi Wang (not Martijn) as the person who threatened and intimidated

### ALLEGATION 14 (Brad Bao — Character Attack)

> *"Resident of California. Co-founder and former CEO of Lime (scooter company). Embroiled in lawsuits: fraud against City of SF, class actions for negligence/ADA, catastrophic injury suits, 46-plaintiff defect mass-tort, employment misclassification ($MM settlement 2022). Khosla Ventures IV suing Bao for fraud re collapsed $30M acqui-hire of Boosted Inc."*

**VERDICT: IRRELEVANT — CHARACTER ASSASSINATION, NOT EVIDENCE OF CERE FRAUD**

#### Rebuttal

**A. The Lime Lawsuits Are Completely Irrelevant to Cere Network**

This is textbook character assassination. The complaint devotes an entire paragraph to lawsuits involving **Lime** — a massive, VC-backed scooter company valued at billions of dollars — to imply that Brad Bao is a serial wrongdoer. This is logically and legally fallacious:

- **Lime operated at massive scale.** Any company with millions of users deploying physical hardware on public streets will face lawsuits. Uber, Lyft, Bird, and every other mobility company faced identical categories of litigation: ADA compliance, personal injury, regulatory disputes, employment classification. These are the **cost of doing business at scale**, not evidence of fraud.
- **Class actions and mass torts against product companies are routine.** Every major consumer product company faces these. Filing a product liability suit against a scooter company is not evidence that the company's CEO committed crypto fraud years later at a completely different venture.
- **Employment misclassification** (the $MM settlement) was an industry-wide issue affecting Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart, and every gig economy company. California's AB5 legislation targeted the entire sector. Settlement ≠ admission of wrongdoing.
- **The Khosla Ventures / Boosted Inc. matter** — even if true — relates to an entirely separate transaction in a different industry. Brad Bao's business disputes at other companies do not establish that he committed fraud at Cere Network.

**B. The Complaint Provides No Cere-Specific Evidence Against Brad**

After the character attack, the complaint provides **no specific factual allegations** of what Brad Bao personally did at Cere Network that constituted fraud. It uses Lime lawsuits as a substitute for actual evidence of misconduct at Cere.

---

### ALLEGATION 15 (Brad Bao — Cere Role)

> *"Board member of Cere Network as purported 'independent' advisor. Lent credibility and approved wrongdoing despite knowing representations were fraudulent. Accepted director's fee and early investor token allocation. Obtained insider knowledge of fraudulent scheme, promoted and lent reputation to Cere Network, profited from scheme. Approved transactions that Jin designed to misappropriate funds including $16.6M from public sale and $41.78M in token sales. Later turned blind eye to accounting fraud."*

**VERDICT: FALSE / UNSUPPORTED**

#### Rebuttal

**A. Board Advisor Role Was Legitimate and Standard**

- Startup companies routinely appoint board advisors and independent directors to provide governance oversight, industry expertise, and credibility. This is a standard feature of corporate governance — not evidence of conspiracy.
- Brad Bao's role as a board advisor to Cere was a **standard startup governance arrangement**. Accepting a director's fee and token allocation is normal compensation for board service in the crypto industry.

**B. Board Members Rely on Management Representations**

- Board advisors and directors operate at a **governance level**, not an operational level. They rely on financial reports, management presentations, and auditor reports to exercise oversight.
- Board members do not control day-to-day token distribution operations, Fireblocks signing processes, or investor communications.
- The complaint alleges Brad "approved wrongdoing despite knowing representations were fraudulent" — but provides **no evidence** of what Brad specifically knew, when he knew it, or what information was presented to him. This is a conclusory allegation without factual support.

**C. Same $41.78M Figure — Recycled Again**

- The identical $41.78M is now attributed to **yet another defendant**. The complaint attributes this same figure to Maren Schwarzer, Xin Jin, Martijn Broersma, and Brad Bao. The mathematical impossibility of each defendant independently controlling the same $41.78M underscores the complaint's lack of specificity.

**D. "Turned Blind Eye to Accounting Fraud" — Conclusory**

- The complaint provides no evidence of what "accounting fraud" existed, what Brad was shown, or what he should have done differently. If the board was presented with manipulated information (by Kenzi Wang, who controlled key financial documents including the Token Sale Tracker), then the board was itself a victim of Kenzi's fraud — not a participant.

#### Evidence References
- Board governance documents — meeting frequency, materials provided, voting records
- Note for counsel: ⚠️ Fred should clarify what financial information was shared with board members

---

### ALLEGATION 16 (Francois Granade)

> *"Individual in California and France. Longstanding associate of Jin. Received compensation as board member. Held himself out as independent director and fiduciary. Served on Cere board alongside Jin and Bao. Aware of misappropriation, undisclosed related-party transactions, and absence of basic financial controls/statements."*

**VERDICT: UNSUPPORTED / REQUIRES FACTUAL DEVELOPMENT**

#### Rebuttal

**A. Board Service Is Not Evidence of Conspiracy**

- Serving as a board member alongside the CEO is how **every board works**. The complaint treats standard corporate governance as sinister.
- Receiving board compensation is standard practice. The complaint frames ordinary director compensation as profiting from fraud.
- "Longstanding associate of Jin" — founders and early-stage companies recruit board members from their professional networks. This is normal.

**B. "Aware of Misappropriation" — Based on What Evidence?**

- The complaint alleges awareness without specifying **what** Francois knew, **when** he knew it, **who** told him, or **what evidence** he received. These are conclusory allegations.
- If Francois was presented with the same manipulated information that Kenzi Wang created (including the separate Token Sale Tracker and the fabricated investor communications), then Francois — like the rest of the company — was a victim of Kenzi's information control.

**C. "Absence of Basic Financial Controls" — Requires Factual Development**

- This allegation requires review against actual corporate governance practices.
- Note for counsel: ⚠️ Fred must clarify: What financial controls existed? Were there audited financials? What reporting was provided to the board? What was the frequency and content of board meetings?
- Many early-stage crypto companies operate with evolving financial controls. The absence of Fortune-500-level accounting does not constitute fraud — it reflects the reality of startup operations.

**D. Francois Was Not Operationally Involved in Token Distribution**

- Board members were not involved in day-to-day Fireblocks operations, investor wallet address collection, or distribution execution. These were operational functions performed by the team.

#### Evidence References
- Board meeting minutes and materials
- Note for counsel: ⚠️ Critical evidence gap — need Fred's input on financial controls and board reporting

### ALLEGATION 17 (Cerebellum Network Inc. — "Shell Company")

> *"Corporation incorporated in Delaware. SHELL COMPANY used to receive/send illicit funds. Jin is ultimate beneficial owner."*

**VERDICT: FALSE — THIS IS THE PRIMARY OPERATING ENTITY**

#### Rebuttal

Cerebellum Network Inc. is **the opposite of a shell company.** It is the primary operating entity of the Cere Network project with documented, verifiable operations:

| Attribute | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|
| **Employees** | Engineers, operations staff, management on payroll. Glassdoor reviews confirm employees worked there (the reviews themselves, whether positive or negative, confirm real employment). |
| **Bank accounts** | Maintained corporate banking relationships for payroll, vendor payments, and operations |
| **Investor contracts** | Party to investment agreements with 160+ private investors and 5,000+ Republic investors |
| **Fireblocks infrastructure** | Operated multi-signature token custody via Fireblocks — a regulated, institutional-grade custody platform |
| **Republic offering** | Listed as the offering entity on Republic.com — Republic conducted its own due diligence before allowing the offering |
| **Federal litigation — as PLAINTIFF** | Filed Cerebellum Networks v. Wang (4:23-cv-02444, N.D. Cal., May 2023) — shell companies do not file and prosecute federal lawsuits |
| **Co-plaintiff in second federal suit** | Named plaintiff in Interdata Network v. Wang, Nailwal, Hu (3:25-cv-03798, N.D. Cal., May 2025) |
| **Legal counsel** | Represented by Matthew F. Miller, Hanson Bridgett LLP, San Francisco — a prominent law firm |
| **Fundraising** | Raised approximately $42.9M through documented capital raises (est. January 2019) |
| **Token distribution** | Successfully distributed tokens to 5,160+ investors |

**The legal test for a "shell company"** is an entity with no or nominal operations, no significant assets, and no legitimate business purpose — existing only to hold or transfer assets. Cerebellum Network Inc. fails every element of that test: it had significant operations, employed real people, managed real assets, executed real transactions with thousands of counterparties, and pursued real litigation.

**"Jin is ultimate beneficial owner"** — Fred Jin being the founder and beneficial owner of the company he founded is not evidence of fraud. Every startup founder is the beneficial owner of their company. This is a tautology.

### ALLEGATION 18 (Interdata Network Ltd. — "Shell Company")

> *"Corporation incorporated in BVI. SHELL COMPANY and US controlled foreign entity used to receive/send illicit funds and tokens. Jin is ultimate beneficial owner."*

**VERDICT: FALSE — STANDARD INDUSTRY STRUCTURE, ACTIVELY LITIGATING IN US COURTS**

#### Rebuttal

**A. BVI Entities Are Industry Standard for Token Projects**

Using a BVI (or similar offshore) entity for token issuance and international operations is **the norm, not the exception** in the blockchain industry. This is not evidence of fraud — it is evidence of following standard legal advice from every reputable crypto law firm:

| Project | Token Issuance Entity Jurisdiction | Shell Company? |
|---------|-----------------------------------|----------------|
| **Ethereum** | Swiss Stiftung (Stiftung Ethereum) | No — foundation of the #2 blockchain |
| **Solana** | Cayman Islands | No — foundation of a $50B+ blockchain |
| **Polkadot / Web3 Foundation** | Swiss Stiftung | No — major blockchain ecosystem |
| **Avalanche** | Cayman Islands | No — major L1 blockchain |
| **Cardano** | Swiss Foundation | No — major blockchain platform |
| **Near Protocol** | Swiss entity | No — VC-backed blockchain |
| **Cosmos** | Swiss Foundation (ICF) | No — major blockchain ecosystem |
| **Cere Network / Interdata** | BVI | Following identical industry practice |

If using a BVI entity for token operations constitutes being a "shell company," then **every major blockchain project in existence is a shell company.** The complaint's characterization is either ignorant of industry practice or deliberately misleading.

**B. Interdata Is Actively Litigating in US Federal Courts**

Interdata Network is the **named plaintiff** in *Interdata Network, Inc. v. Wang, Nailwal, Hu* (Case 3:25-cv-03798, N.D. Cal., filed May 1, 2025). It is actively prosecuting a federal lawsuit against Kenzi Wang and Sandeep Nailwal.

**Shell companies do not file federal lawsuits.** Filing and prosecuting litigation requires legal standing, corporate authority, authorized agents, and ongoing legal representation. Interdata retained **Hanson Bridgett LLP** (a major San Francisco law firm) and has been an active litigant before Judge James Donato for over a year.

**C. "US Controlled Foreign Entity" — Standard Tax Classification**

Being classified as a "controlled foreign corporation" (CFC) is a **US tax classification**, not evidence of fraud. CFCs are subject to specific IRS reporting requirements (Subpart F, GILTI, etc.). Having a CFC is evidence of **compliance** with US tax law, not evasion of it.

#### Evidence References
- BVI incorporation documents
- CourtListener docket for 3:25-cv-03798 — showing Interdata as active plaintiff
- Industry comparison — entity structures of Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, Avalanche, etc.
- Note for counsel: ⚠️ Produce BVI good standing certificate and corporate records

### ALLEGATION 19 (CEF AI Inc. — "Illicit Proceeds")

> *"Corporation incorporated in Delaware. Start-up owned/controlled by Jin used to receive/send illicit funds. Jin used and is using illicit proceeds from Cere fraud to fund CEF AI."*

**VERDICT: FALSE — LEGITIMATE NEW VENTURE; NO EVIDENCE OF "ILLICIT PROCEEDS"**

#### Rebuttal

**A. Starting a New Company After a Prior Venture Is Normal Entrepreneurship**

- CEF AI Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 2024 as an AI-focused technology venture.
- Founders start new companies when they identify new opportunities. This is how Silicon Valley works. The complaint frames normal entrepreneurial activity as criminal conduct.
- Examples of serial entrepreneurs who launched new ventures after prior companies:
  - **Elon Musk**: Zip2 → PayPal → SpaceX → Tesla → Neuralink → xAI
  - **Jack Dorsey**: Twitter → Square/Block
  - **Reid Hoffman**: SocialNet → LinkedIn → Greylock
  - **Brian Armstrong**: Prior roles → Coinbase
- Starting CEF AI in 2024 is evidence of continued entrepreneurial activity, not evidence of fraud.

**B. "Using Illicit Proceeds to Fund CEF AI" — Conclusory and Unsubstantiated**

- The complaint provides **no evidence** that any specific funds flowing to CEF AI originated from fraudulent activity.
- The premise of this allegation depends on the premise that the Cere "fraud" occurred as the complaint describes — which we have thoroughly rebutted. The Practus LLP investigation found no evidence that Fred Jin misappropriated funds. The actual fund diversion was committed by Kenzi Wang.
- If the underlying fraud allegation fails (which it does), then the "illicit proceeds" allegation necessarily fails as well.

**C. Delaware Incorporation = Transparency, Not Fraud**

- Incorporating in Delaware provides maximum transparency: Delaware corporations are subject to Delaware General Corporation Law, one of the most developed and well-regulated corporate law frameworks in the world.
- If Fred Jin were trying to hide assets, he would not incorporate a new company in Delaware under his own name.

#### Evidence References
- CEF AI Delaware incorporation documents
- Practus LLP investigation — no evidence of Fred Jin misappropriating funds (the underlying premise of this allegation)
- Note for counsel: ⚠️ Ensure clean documentation of CEF AI's funding sources

### ALLEGATION 27 (Vivian Liu Introduction — Backstory)

> *"In 2019, Vivian Liu was introduced to Fred Jin. Liu had crypto experience. Jin had launched two online companies that had eventually failed."*

**VERDICT: PARTIALLY TRUE / MISLEADING FRAMING**

#### Rebuttal

**A. "Two Online Companies That Eventually Failed" — This Is Normal**

- The "two companies" are **Funler** (2015, mobile gaming) and **Bitlearn** (2017, education-blockchain).
- **~90% of startups fail.** This is the most fundamental fact of entrepreneurship. Having two prior companies that didn't achieve lasting success is **the norm** for founders, not evidence of fraud.
- The complaint frames normal startup failure as a "pattern of fraud" — an allegation that, if taken seriously, would criminalize entrepreneurship itself.
- **The framing is deliberately misleading:** saying someone "launched companies that eventually failed" implies intentional wrongdoing, when in reality it describes the statistical baseline experience of the overwhelming majority of startup founders.

**B. Vivian Liu Was in Kenzi Wang's Investor/Advisor Circle**

- The introduction of Vivian to Cere came through the network in which **Kenzi Wang** operated. Vivian and Kenzi were in the same investor/advisor circle in the crypto industry.
- This is critical context: Kenzi had a **pre-existing relationship with Vivian** that he later exploited when he volunteered to be her sole contact at Cere (December 23, 2021: *"I'll handle Vivian"*).
- The complaint omits that the person who facilitated the relationship is the same person who later stole Vivian's tokens.

**C. "Liu Had Crypto Experience" — Relevant to Sophistication Defense**

- If Vivian had crypto experience, she was a **sophisticated investor** who understood the risks inherent in early-stage token investments, including price volatility, project risk, and the possibility of total loss.
- Sophisticated investors are held to a higher standard regarding reliance on representations. The complaint cannot simultaneously claim Vivian was an experienced crypto investor and that she was an unsophisticated victim who was easily deceived.

**D. The Bitlearn Connection Undermines the Complaint's Own Narrative**

- Kenzi Wang **himself joined Bitlearn's advisory board** when Fred Jin was CEO (confirmed by the Bitlearn Medium article, April 2018).
- If Bitlearn were a "fraudulent company" (as the complaint implies by calling it a "failed" venture), why would Kenzi voluntarily associate himself with it? Kenzi's choice to join Bitlearn demonstrates that **he** trusted Fred Jin — contradicting the complaint's attempt to portray Fred's prior ventures as part of a fraud pattern.
- This fact also establishes that the Kenzi-Fred relationship **predates Cere Network** by at least a year, giving Kenzi time to study Fred's operations and identify opportunities for exploitation.

#### Evidence References
- Bitlearn Medium article (April 2018) — Kenzi joining Fred's advisory board voluntarily
- Startup failure statistics (CB Insights, Failory, etc.) — documenting 90%+ failure rate
- Internal Slack messages (December 23, 2021) — Kenzi volunteering for Vivian
- Vivian's investment documentation — showing her as a sophisticated crypto investor

### ALLEGATION 28 (Binance Listing Promise, Return on Investment)

> *"Jin promised Liu connection with Binance, listing within 6 months. Promised return on investment with profits. Liu agreed to work only if Jin promised 100% dedication to Cere. Jin made this promise."*

**VERDICT: PARTIALLY TRUE / MISLEADING — THE PROMISES WERE KEPT**

#### Rebuttal

**A. Cere WAS Listed on Binance — The Promise Was Fulfilled**

The complaint frames the Binance listing as a broken promise. In fact, **Cere Network was listed on Binance** via **Binance Launchpool** — one of Binance's premier listing programs. This is a verifiable, public fact:

- Binance Launchpool is a curated program; projects are vetted by Binance before inclusion. Being selected for Launchpool is a significant validation of a project's legitimacy.
- The Binance listing was announced publicly and CERE was tradeable on the Binance platform.
- If the "promise" was to get Cere listed on Binance, that promise was **kept**.
- Whether the listing occurred within exactly 6 months of a specific conversation in 2019 is a detail the complaint does not substantiate with dated evidence.

**B. "Promised Return on Investment with Profits" — Misleading Characterization**

- No legitimate crypto project guarantees returns. Crypto investments are inherently speculative, as every sophisticated investor (including Vivian, who the complaint says "had crypto experience") understands.
- If Fred expressed optimism about Cere's prospects, that is standard founder enthusiasm — not a binding guarantee of profits. Every pitch deck in Silicon Valley expresses confidence in the venture's potential.
- The complaint provides no written documentation of a "guarantee" of returns. Verbal expressions of confidence in a startup's prospects are not actionable fraud.

**C. "100% Dedication to Cere" — Fred HAS Dedicated Himself to Cere**

- Fred Jin has been CEO of Cere Network from its founding in **2019 through the present day (2026)** — **seven years** of continuous leadership.
- He is actively defending the company in multiple lawsuits, coordinating legal strategy, and leading the counterclaim.
- The complaint's own narrative acknowledges Fred ran Cere for years. The "100% dedication" promise, if made, was demonstrably kept.
- The launch of CEF AI in 2024 came **five years** after Cere's founding — and represents a natural evolution/pivot, not abandonment. Many founders lead multiple related initiatives (e.g., Elon Musk simultaneously running Tesla, SpaceX, and other ventures).

#### Evidence References
- Binance Launchpool listing — publicly verifiable on Binance
- Fred Jin's continuous CEO tenure (2019–present)
- Note for counsel: Review any written communications regarding Binance listing timeline

### ALLEGATION 29 (DDC Platform)

> *"Jin promoted Cere Network as a decentralized data cloud (DDC) platform."*

**VERDICT: TRUE — AND THE DDC PLATFORM EXISTS AND FUNCTIONS**

#### Rebuttal

This allegation is presented as though the DDC (Decentralized Data Cloud) was vaporware. **It is not.** The DDC is a real, deployed, functioning platform:

| Evidence | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| **Proofi Wallet** | Built on DDC infrastructure — a functioning application using the platform |
| **DDC Bucket #1229** | Exists and verifiable on the Cere mainnet — real on-chain data storage |
| **DAC Merkle Proofs** | Decentralized Access Control with verified Merkle proofs — cryptographic proof the system works |
| **Storage Nodes** | Real storage nodes running on the network |
| **Technical Documentation** | Published architecture documentation describing the DDC system |
| **Open Source Code** | Deployed and available for inspection |

The complaint implies that describing Cere as a DDC platform was fraudulent. The evidence shows the DDC is **real technology that was actually built and deployed.** Whether or not the token price declined (due to the 2022–2023 market-wide crash), the underlying technology exists and functions.

The complaint conflates **token price performance** with **product viability**. These are independent variables: a real product can exist while its associated token declines in value (as happened across virtually the entire crypto market in 2022–2023).

#### Evidence References
- DDC technical documentation
- Proofi wallet — live application on DDC
- On-chain data: DDC Bucket #1229 on Cere mainnet
- DAC Merkle proof verification
- Note for counsel: Prepare technical demonstration materials for DDC

### ALLEGATION 37 (Vivian's Advisory Role Description)

> *"Jin wanted Liu to lure in private investors and assist in building/development of Cere Token. Described role as senior strategic advisor covering execution strategy, token planning, and fundraising."*

**VERDICT: PARTIALLY TRUE — BUT FRAMING IS MISLEADING**

#### Rebuttal

**A. "Lure In Private Investors" — Misleading Characterization of Standard Advisory Work**

- Introducing potential investors to a startup is the **primary function of a strategic advisor** in the crypto industry. This is not "luring" — it is business development and fundraising support.
- The complaint uses the word "lure" to imply deception. There is no evidence that Vivian was asked to deceive anyone. She was asked to make introductions — standard advisory work.

**B. The Advisory Scope Was Legitimate**

- "Execution strategy, token planning, and fundraising" is a completely standard scope for a strategic advisor in crypto. These are real business functions, not evidence of fraud.
- Cere Network was a real company raising real capital for real technology development. Engaging advisors to support that effort is normal corporate behavior.

**C. Key Context: Kenzi Wang Was Also an Advisor**

- Kenzi Wang was simultaneously serving as an advisor/investor to Cere through AU21 Capital. Both Vivian and Kenzi were in advisory roles — but it was **Kenzi** who exploited his access to steal funds and tokens.

---

### ALLEGATION 38 (Advisor Agreement Execution)

> *"Liu executed Advisor Agreement dated July 23, 2019."*

**VERDICT: TRUE — AND SUPPORTS OUR POSITION**

#### Rebuttal

- The existence of a signed Advisor Agreement **supports our position**: Vivian had a legitimate relationship with Cere Network, was owed tokens under a real agreement, and those tokens were allocated for distribution to her.
- The signed agreement, dated July 23, 2019, was between Vivian Liu (signed as "Lujunjin Liu") and Cere Network.
- **The tokens were distributed** — to a wallet address that Vivian says she never provided. This is precisely the point: the agreement was honored by Cere operationally (tokens were sent), but **Kenzi Wang intercepted the distribution** by inserting a fake wallet address.
- Vivian's legitimate claim to tokens under this agreement makes Kenzi's theft more, not less, culpable — he stole from someone who had a documented legal right to receive them.

---

### ⚠️ ALLEGATION 39 (Entity Naming Discrepancy — CRITICAL)

> *"Advisor Agreement was countersigned by Cere Network, Inc. In 2025, Liu recently discovered that the entity known as Cere Network, Inc. did not appear to be listed as a registered company in either California or Delaware, and there is no evidence that this entity ever existed as named."*

**VERDICT: MISLEADING — NAMING TECHNICALITY, NOT EVIDENCE OF FRAUD**

#### Rebuttal

**A. The Operating Entity Is "Cerebellum Network Inc." — "Cere Network" Is the DBA/Brand Name**

This allegation exploits a **naming discrepancy** between the legal entity name and the brand/DBA name:

| Name Used | Context | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Cerebellum Network Inc.** | Legal entity name — Delaware incorporation | ✅ Registered, active, documented |
| **Cere Network** | Brand name / DBA / trade name used in all public-facing materials | ✅ The well-known brand name |
| **"Cere Network, Inc."** | Name used on the Advisor Agreement | Informal usage of brand name with "Inc." appended |

- **Every major company operates under brand names that differ from their legal entity names.** Google's legal entity is Alphabet Inc. Meta's was Facebook, Inc. Cere Network's legal entity is Cerebellum Network Inc. This is universally common.
- Using "Cere Network, Inc." on an advisor agreement when the legal entity is "Cerebellum Network Inc." is a **minor naming inconsistency** — not evidence that the entity "did not exist." The entity existed. It is documented in Delaware incorporation records, federal court filings, Republic offerings, and hundreds of contracts.
- The work was real, the tokens were allocated, the agreement was performed by both sides. A technicality about the exact legal name on one document does not void the underlying business relationship.

**B. The Complaint's Own Logic Defeats This Argument**

- The complaint **itself** names "Cerebellum Network Inc." as a defendant (proving the entity exists).
- The complaint also names "Interdata Network Ltd." and "CEF AI Inc." as defendants — acknowledging these entities exist.
- If the complaint's position is that "Cere Network, Inc." doesn't exist, but "Cerebellum Network Inc." does, then the advisor agreement was simply countersigned under the brand name rather than the legal entity name. This is a correctable technicality, not fraud.

**C. The Entity Question Actually Helps Our Defense**

- If the complaint argues the contracting entity technically didn't exist under that exact name, it weakens their own breach-of-contract claim (Cause of Action 7: "Breach of Token Sale Agreement"). You cannot claim breach by an entity you simultaneously claim doesn't exist.
- The real entity — Cerebellum Network Inc. — **did perform** under the agreement: it allocated tokens and distributed them to a wallet address on file. The fraud was in the **wallet address** (inserted by Kenzi), not in the entity's existence or performance.

#### Evidence References
- Delaware Secretary of State — Cerebellum Network Inc. incorporation records
- Advisor Agreement (July 23, 2019) — showing "Cere Network, Inc." nomenclature
- Federal court filings — 4:23-cv-02444 and 3:25-cv-03798 (Cerebellum Network as party)
- Republic offering page — "Cere Network" as brand name for Cerebellum Network Inc.
- Note for counsel: ⚠️ CRITICAL — Fred must clarify: Was there ever a "Cere Network, Inc." entity? Or was it always "Cerebellum Network Inc." doing business as "Cere Network"? Obtain any DBA filings.

### ALLEGATIONS 40–41 (Advisory Scope and Compensation Terms)

> *Allegation 40: "Under Advisor Agreement, Liu agreed to consult/advise on: (1) strategy on short/long term execution plans, (2) fundraising, BD, marketing, technical support, investor intros, (3) advising on token issuance, governance, security, community/marketing."*
>
> *Allegation 41: "Compensation: 0.2% of total network = ~20M tokens on 2-year vesting schedule, monthly. Distribution in 3 tranches: 10% upon exchange listing, 40% after 6 months, 50% 1 year after that."*

**VERDICT: TRUE — AND SUPPORTS OUR COUNTER-NARRATIVE**

#### Rebuttal

**A. We Do Not Dispute the Agreement Terms**

The advisory scope and compensation terms as described are consistent with our records. Vivian Liu agreed to provide advisory services in exchange for 20,000,000 CERE tokens on a vesting schedule.

**B. These Facts Support Our Position, Not the Plaintiff's**

The advisory agreement terms are actually **helpful to our defense and counterclaim**:

1. **Vivian was owed real tokens** under a real agreement → This establishes the value of what Kenzi Wang stole from her.
2. **The tokens were allocated and distributed** → Cere performed its obligation. 33,333,334 CERE (the investment allocation + advisory allocation) were sent to the wallet address on file.
3. **The wallet address was not Vivian's** → Kenzi Wang inserted a fake address (see Allegation 1 rebuttal).
4. **The theft was Kenzi's, not Cere's** → Cere followed its standard distribution process. The manipulation occurred at the address-entry stage, where Kenzi controlled the information flow.

**C. The Vesting Schedule Shows Legitimate Structure**

- Token vesting schedules (10% at listing, 40% at 6 months, 50% at 1 year) are **standard in the crypto industry** and demonstrate a properly structured advisor agreement — not a scheme to defraud.
- The existence of a multi-tranche vesting schedule contradicts the "pump and dump" allegation: vesting exists precisely to **prevent** immediate selling and ensure long-term alignment.

---

### ALLEGATIONS 42–44 (Vivian's Work Performed — 300-400 Hours)

> *Allegation 42: "From July 2019 through end of 2021, Liu performed agreed services. Prepared pitch decks, roadmaps, milestones. Introduced Jin to investors, reviewed BD pitches, attended investor meetings. Advised on security audits, community design, governance design."*
>
> *Allegation 43: "Liu worked about 10-20 hours per week, with spikes. Estimates 300-400 hours total."*
>
> *Allegation 44: "Work performed in California."*

**VERDICT: ACCEPTED FOR PURPOSES OF ARGUMENT — AND THIS IS THE STRONGEST EVIDENCE THAT VIVIAN IS SUING THE WRONG DEFENDANT**

#### Rebuttal

**A. We Do Not Necessarily Dispute That Vivian Performed Advisory Work**

- We accept, for purposes of argument, that Vivian performed advisory services as described, including investor introductions, pitch deck review, and governance advisory.
- 300–400 hours over approximately 2.5 years (July 2019 – end of 2021) is **~10–13 hours per month** — a reasonable level of engagement for a strategic advisor who is not full-time. This is consistent with legitimate advisory work.
- We note, however, that **no invoices were ever submitted** to the company, and the company was never informed of the scope of work in real time. All communication regarding Vivian's work was channeled through **Kenzi Wang**, who served as the sole intermediary.

**B. This Is the Strongest Evidence That Vivian Should Be Suing Kenzi, Not Cere**

The following chain of facts — accepted by both sides — tells the real story:

| Fact | Source | Significance |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Vivian performed real advisory work | Complaint ¶¶42–43 | Vivian had a legitimate claim to tokens |
| Vivian was owed ~20M advisory tokens + 33.3M investment tokens | Advisor Agreement + Investment Agreement | Total allocation: 53.3M CERE |
| 33,333,334 CERE were distributed by Cere | On-chain records (Blocks 4,361,724 & 5,019,196) | Cere performed its distribution obligation |
| The tokens were sent to a wallet Vivian never controlled | Vivian's own admission | The wallet address was fraudulent |
| Kenzi Wang was the sole intermediary with Vivian | Slack (Dec 23, 2021): "I'll handle Vivian" | Kenzi controlled all information flow |
| A "deleted user" entered the wallet address | Google Sheets edit history | Someone with insider access inserted the fake address |
| Tokens were drained within ~8 hours via test-then-sweep | On-chain records | Operational behavior of someone managing a theft |
| Tokens were bridged to Ethereum and sold on KuCoin | Etherscan tx hashes (see Allegation 1) | Full liquidation on non-US exchange |
| The bridge wallet was funded by Kenzi's identified wallet | Etherscan (Feb 1–2, 2024) | Direct on-chain link to Kenzi Wang |
| The bridge wallet also received AU21 portfolio tokens | Etherscan (Jan 31, 2024) | Unique portfolio fingerprint: RAZE + SKYRIM = AU21/Kenzi |

**The logical conclusion:** Vivian did real work. Vivian was owed real tokens. Cere sent real tokens. **Kenzi Wang intercepted them.** Vivian is suing the company that tried to pay her, instead of the person who stole from her.

**C. The "California Work" Allegation Is Relevant to Jurisdiction — But Cuts Both Ways**

- If Vivian performed work in California, that establishes California jurisdiction for her claims — but it also establishes California jurisdiction for a **counterclaim** against the actual perpetrator (Kenzi Wang, who operated from California/Dubai).

**D. Cere's Outreach to Vivian Demonstrates Good Faith**

- On **November 14, 2023**, Martijn Broersma proactively contacted Vivian and Kevin to inform them about the distribution status and provide transaction details. This is the behavior of a company that believed it had fulfilled its obligations.
- Vivian/Kevin's response (brief engagement, then ghosting) is consistent with **Kenzi directing them to stop communicating** with Cere once questions were being asked about the wallet address discrepancy.
- A company running a fraud scheme does not proactively contact the victim to provide transaction records. This contact demonstrates Cere's good faith.

#### Evidence References
- Advisor Agreement (July 23, 2019) — terms and scope
- On-chain distribution records — Blocks 4,361,724 and 5,019,196

### ALLEGATION 45 (Jin's Representations to Liu — Five Sub-Claims)

> *a. "Jin assured lock-up provisions for insiders to align interests with investors and guard against dumping"*
> *b. "Jin represented no insider would dump tokens upon launch, distribution carefully managed"*
> *c. "Jin represented Cere Network had multiple Fortune 500 customers with revenue and was profitable"*
> *d. "Jin told Liu tokens would be valuable, project valuation would grow with partnerships including Expedia"*
> *e. "Jin assured funds raised would be used for platform development"*

**VERDICT: REQUIRES FACTUAL DEVELOPMENT — BUT CONTEXT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGES THE PICTURE**

#### Rebuttal

**Preliminary Note:** This allegation contains five discrete sub-claims that require individual treatment. Several require factual input from Fred Jin before a complete rebuttal can be prepared. However, each must be evaluated against the overarching factual reality: **the person behind this complaint — Kenzi Wang — is the one who stole tokens and diverted funds**, not Fred Jin.

---

**A. Lock-Up Provisions and Anti-Dumping Assurances (45a–b)**

**Assessment: PARTIALLY TRUE — VESTING DID EXIST; THE VIOLATIONS WERE KENZI'S**

- Token vesting schedules **were implemented**. The complaint's own Allegation 41 describes the vesting terms for Vivian's advisory tokens (10% at listing, 40% at 6 months, 50% at 1 year). This demonstrates vesting was real, documented, and applied to participants.
- The distribution to 5,000+ Republic investors and 160+ private investors followed vesting schedules. Tokens were distributed according to documented timelines.
- If any insider violated vesting restrictions by selling tokens prematurely, the evidence from the forensic investigation points to **Kenzi Wang** — who directed 75+ token purchasers to send payment to his personal wallets, maintained a separate "Token Sale Tracker," diverted $4.8M+ outside company control, and actively liquidated CERE tokens through January 2026.
- The Practus LLP investigation found **no evidence** of Fred Jin violating vesting schedules or secretly dumping tokens.

**⚠️ Note for counsel:** Fred must confirm: Did he personally sell any CERE tokens outside the vesting schedule? If so, when, how much, and through what mechanism? This is a factual question that must be answered precisely.

---

**B. Fortune 500 Customers / Revenue / Profitability (45c)**

**Assessment: ⚠️ REQUIRES FRED INPUT — CRITICAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN PILOTS AND PAYING CUSTOMERS**

This is potentially the most legally sensitive sub-claim and requires careful factual development:

- There is an important **spectrum of enterprise engagement** in the tech/blockchain industry:
  - **Paying customers** with signed contracts and recognized revenue
  - **Enterprise pilots** — trial deployments with large companies, often free or at reduced cost
  - **Letters of intent (LOIs)** — non-binding expressions of interest
  - **Partnership discussions** — exploratory conversations
  - **Integrations** — technical connections that may or may not involve revenue

- Many early-stage tech companies, particularly in blockchain, describe their enterprise pipeline in optimistic terms. The distinction between "we have Fortune 500 pilots" and "we have Fortune 500 paying customers" is significant.
- If Fred represented Cere as having "Fortune 500 customers with revenue" when the relationships were actually pilots or LOIs, this could be characterized as puffery (optimistic but common) or misrepresentation (if specific revenue figures were cited).
- If Fred represented Cere as "profitable" when it was not generating net positive revenue, this requires explanation.

**⚠️ Note for counsel — CRITICAL:**
- Fred must provide a detailed accounting of: Which Fortune 500/1000 companies had relationships with Cere? What was the nature of each relationship (paying customer, pilot, LOI, partnership, integration)? What revenue, if any, did Cere generate from enterprise clients? When did Fred make these representations, to whom, and in what context (pitch deck, one-on-one, written/verbal)?
- Review all pitch decks, investor presentations, and marketing materials for specific claims about enterprise traction and revenue.

---

**C. Token Value and Partnerships Including Expedia (45d)**

**Assessment: ⚠️ REQUIRES FACTUAL DEVELOPMENT**

- Expressions of confidence about token value are **standard in startup fundraising** and are generally treated as forward-looking statements/opinions, not guarantees.
- The **Expedia partnership** claim requires verification:
  - Was there a real relationship with Expedia? (LOI, pilot, integration, partnership agreement?)
  - If a relationship existed, was it accurately characterized?
  - If no relationship existed, this is a significant misrepresentation.
- Many blockchain projects have "partnerships" that range from full technical integrations to a single exploratory meeting. The characterization matters.

**⚠️ Note for counsel:** Fred must clarify the Expedia relationship specifically. What was the actual nature, scope, and documentation of any Expedia engagement?

---

**D. Funds Used for Platform Development (45e)**

**Assessment: LIKELY TRUE — LEGITIMATE OPERATIONAL SPENDING OCCURRED**

- Cere Network **did develop real technology**: the DDC platform, Proofi wallet, mainnet deployment, storage nodes, DAC Merkle proofs (see Allegation 29 rebuttal).
- The company **did employ engineers** — Glassdoor reviews (positive and negative) confirm real employment at Cere Network.
- Real development spending occurred: engineering salaries, infrastructure costs, cloud services, security audits, node operations.
- The DHTY forensic audit identified $4,817,900 diverted by **Kenzi Wang** — not by Fred Jin. The remaining funds (the vast majority of the $42.9M raised) were used for operations, including platform development.
- The complaint's implicit claim — that zero funds went to development — is contradicted by the existence of a functioning DDC platform with deployed technology.

**⚠️ Note for counsel:** Obtain a high-level breakdown of operational spending (engineering, infrastructure, marketing, legal, G&A) to demonstrate that raised funds were used for legitimate business purposes. A forensic accountant's confirmation that the majority of funds went to operations would be powerful evidence.

### ALLEGATIONS 46–47 (Pattern of Fraud — Funler → Bitlearn → Cere)

> *Allegation 46: "Jin established recurring pattern of fraudulent business conduct: launching ventures, raising funds under false pretenses, maintaining appearances until insiders extract value, then abandoning. Pattern: Funler → Bitlearn → Cere Network."*
>
> *Allegation 47: "Plaintiffs were unaware of prior failures. Jin misrepresented Funler and Bitlearn as strategic pivots/successes. Portrayed Cere as backed by Fortune-1000 clients, sustainable revenues, 50+ person team."*

**VERDICT: FALSE — SERIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS NOT SERIAL FRAUD**

#### Rebuttal

**A. The "Pattern" Argument Fails Because There Is No Pattern of Fraud**

For a pattern to exist, each constituent venture must involve fraudulent conduct. The complaint provides **no evidence of fraud** at Funler or Bitlearn — only that they "eventually failed." Failure is not fraud:

| Venture | What Happened | Fraud Evidence? |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Funler (2015)** | Mobile gaming startup that didn't achieve lasting success | **None.** No lawsuit, no fraud allegation, no criminal charge. A gaming startup failing is statistically normal. |
| **Bitlearn (2017)** | Education-blockchain platform that didn't achieve lasting success | **None.** No lawsuit, no fraud allegation. And notably, **Kenzi Wang himself joined Bitlearn's advisory board** (April 2018), demonstrating that he trusted Fred and the venture. |
| **Cere Network (2019)** | Blockchain company still operating in 2026, with real technology deployed | **The fraud was Kenzi Wang's,** per the Practus LLP investigation and DHTY forensic audit. |

**Three data points where zero involve proven fraud do not constitute a "pattern of fraud."** They constitute a career in entrepreneurship.

**B. Cere Network Is Still Operating — Not "Abandoned"**

The "pattern" allegation requires that each venture was "abandoned." But:
- Fred Jin is **still the CEO of Cere Network in 2026** — seven years after founding.
- Cere has **active technology** — DDC platform, Proofi wallet, mainnet operations.
- Cere is **actively litigating** to protect itself and its investors.
- Cere distributed tokens to **5,160+ investors** — a real, functioning distribution.
- CEF AI (2024) represents a **pivot**, not abandonment — continuing to build on the technology and relationships developed at Cere.

A company that is still operating seven years after founding, with active technology, active litigation, and a CEO who is still present, has not been "abandoned."

**C. "Misrepresented Funler and Bitlearn as Strategic Pivots/Successes"**

- The complaint provides **no evidence** of specific representations Fred made about Funler and Bitlearn. It does not identify when these representations were made, to whom, in what medium, or with what specific language.
- Describing a prior startup's conclusion in positive terms ("strategic pivot," "learning experience," "building block") is universal in entrepreneurship. Every founder describes their career trajectory in the best possible light. This is not fraud — it is standard professional presentation.

**D. "50+ Person Team" — Cere Did Have a Substantial Team**

- Cere Network **did employ a substantial team** across multiple jurisdictions (US, EU, potentially Asia). Glassdoor reviews confirm multiple employees. The exact headcount at various points in time should be confirmed by Fred.
- If Cere had 50+ team members at some point during its operations, this statement was accurate. If the number was lower, it may be an overstatement but needs context (were contractors counted? Were part-time advisors counted?).

**⚠️ Note for counsel:** Fred should clarify peak headcount and team composition over time. Obtain payroll records or contractor lists to document actual team size.

**E. The Real "Pattern" — Kenzi Wang's Serial Fraud**

For comparison, here is an actual documented pattern of fraudulent conduct:

| Year | Kenzi Wang's Venture | Outcome |
|------|---------------------|---------|
| 2013–2015 | Buzzstarter/Traction Labs | Marketplace vanished; "acquisition" fabricated (TechCrunch URL → 404) |
| 2017 | Domain squatting (7 domains) | Lost by default in FORUM arbitration (FA1709001750913) |
| 2017 | Stafftopia breach of contract | Lied about mailing a check; settled |
| 2018 | **Grand Theft charge** | SF County Superior Court, Case No. 18017577 |
| 2018 | SuperBloom (SEED) | Dead — BitcoinTalk SCAM WARNING; co-founder: "Tinder Swindler of crypto" |
| 2018 | Sued his own co-founder | LA County Case 18STCV05701 |
| 2019–2023 | Cere Network | Diverted $4.8M; stole 33.3M CERE tokens |
| 2021 | Sued by Vijay Garg | SDNY — fraud, conversion, breach of fiduciary duty |
| 2024 | $ELE meme coin | Implicated in pump-and-dump ($17M → $2M) |

**This is a pattern of fraud.** What the complaint attributes to Fred Jin is actually the documented career of Kenzi Wang.

#### Evidence References
- Bitlearn Medium article (April 2018) — Kenzi joined Fred's project voluntarily
- Glassdoor reviews — confirming real Cere employment
- DDC platform evidence — real technology, still functioning
- Kenzi Wang's criminal timeline — 9+ documented incidents (see Section 4)
- Practus LLP investigation — fraud traced to Kenzi, not Fred

### ALLEGATIONS 48–50 (Fundraising — $42.96M)

> *Allegation 48: "Through Cere Network affiliated companies including Interdata, Jin raised about $42.96 million between 2019 and April 2021."*
>
> *Allegation 49: "~$14.66M of $42.96M raised via private SAFTs (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens)."*
>
> *Allegation 50: "~$28.3M from retail investors on Republic, DAO Maker, and Polkastarter. Over 5,000 retail investors including US investors. Sale prices ranged 2-3.5 cents per token."*

**VERDICT: SUBSTANTIALLY TRUE — AND THIS SUPPORTS OUR DEFENSE**

#### Rebuttal

**A. The Fundraising Was Legitimate, Documented, and Legal**

We do not dispute the general fundraising figures. The capital raise was conducted through proper channels:

| Component | Amount | Platform/Structure | Legal Framework |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Private SAFTs** | ~$14.66M | Direct to institutional/accredited investors | SAFT = recognized legal instrument for pre-token fundraising; standard in crypto industry |
| **Republic** | Portion of ~$28.3M | Republic.com — SEC-registered funding portal | **Regulation D** offering for US investors; Republic conducted due diligence |
| **DAO Maker** | Portion of ~$28.3M | DAO Maker launchpad | Standard crypto launchpad |
| **Polkastarter** | Portion of ~$28.3M | Polkastarter IDO platform | Standard crypto launchpad |
| **Total** | ~$42.96M | | |

**B. The Fundraising Platforms Conducted Their Own Due Diligence**

- **Republic** is a registered funding portal under SEC regulations. Before allowing a Reg D offering on its platform, Republic conducts its own review of the project, team, and offering documents. Republic's acceptance of Cere's offering is independent third-party validation.
- **Kenzi Wang was listed on Republic's Cere offering page as a "General Contributor"** — Republic itself presented Kenzi as part of the legitimate team.
- **Binance Launchpool** subsequently listed CERE — another tier of independent exchange due diligence.

**C. ALL 5,000+ Republic Investors Received Their Tokens**

This is the single most important fact for rebutting the fraud narrative:

- Over **5,000 Republic investors** participated in the token sale.
- Over **160 private SAFT investors** participated.
- **Every single one** received their tokens through the standard distribution process — vesting schedules were applied, Fireblocks was used for multi-sig execution, wallet addresses were collected and verified.
- **Vivian Liu is the sole exception** — and the sole exception is the one investor where **Kenzi Wang inserted himself** as the exclusive intermediary.
- A "classic pump and dump scheme" does not distribute tokens to 5,160+ investors and honor vesting schedules. Pump-and-dump schemes involve withholding tokens from investors while insiders sell. Here, the investors received their tokens. The one exception was sabotaged by Kenzi.

**D. The Fundraising Structure Was Standard**

- **SAFTs** (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens) are a recognized legal instrument developed by Protocol Labs and Cooley LLP, specifically designed for compliant pre-token fundraising. Using SAFTs is evidence of trying to comply with securities law, not evade it.
- Multi-platform token launches (Republic + DAO Maker + Polkastarter) are standard for projects seeking broad distribution.
- Sale prices of 2–3.5 cents per token are consistent with early-stage token pricing.

**E. Where Did the $42.96M Go?**

The complaint implies the funds were stolen. The forensic evidence shows:
- **$4,817,900** was diverted by **Kenzi Wang** (confirmed by DHTY forensic audit)
- The **remaining ~$38M** was used for legitimate operations: engineering, infrastructure, marketing, legal, team salaries across multiple jurisdictions over multiple years
- A company with 50+ team members across US, EU, and other jurisdictions, operating from 2019–2026, will legitimately spend tens of millions on operations. This is not suspicious — it is the cost of running a technology company.

**⚠️ Note for counsel:** Fred should provide a high-level spending breakdown (even approximate) to demonstrate that the non-Kenzi funds were used for operations: payroll, engineering, infrastructure, marketing, legal, node operations, exchange listings, etc.

---

### 🔑 CRITICAL OBSERVATION: THE COMPLAINT CONFLATES TWO SEPARATE NARRATIVES

Before proceeding to Section 3, it is essential to note that the Goopal complaint mixes **two fundamentally different narratives** that must be cleanly separated:

**Narrative 1 (Kenzi's Fabrication):** "Fred Jin is a serial fraudster who stole investor money through a pump-and-dump scheme."
- **This is FALSE.** The Practus LLP investigation found no evidence. The forensic audit traced diversions to Kenzi Wang. The 5,160+ investors who received their tokens prove the distribution system worked.

**Narrative 2 (Actually True):** "Vivian Liu didn't receive her tokens."
- **This is TRUE** — but the complaint names the wrong perpetrator. Vivian's tokens were stolen by **Kenzi Wang**, who inserted himself as sole intermediary, planted a fake wallet address, and cashed out 33.3M CERE on KuCoin.

**Our strategic position for the third-party complaint (TPC) / counterclaim:**

> **We AGREE that Vivian Liu was wronged.** She performed real advisory work (300–400 hours), invested $100,000, and was entitled to 53.3M+ CERE tokens. She never received them.
>
> **We DISAGREE on who wronged her.** The on-chain evidence — immutable, publicly verifiable, and forensically conclusive — proves that **Kenzi Wang** stole her tokens. Not Fred Jin. Not Martijn Broersma. Not Cere Network.
>
> **Both Vivian Liu and Cere Network are victims of the same criminal.** The most efficient resolution would be for Vivian to join Cere in pursuing Kenzi Wang, rather than spending millions litigating against the wrong defendants while Kenzi liquidates the remaining 276M CERE tokens in his identified wallet.

This framing should be the centerpiece of all filings and communications with plaintiff's counsel.

### ALLEGATION 54 (Goopal Agreement Entity — "Cere Network (BVI), Ltd." Doesn't Exist)

> *"Goopal entered agreement with 'Cere Network (BVI) Ltd.' dated July 8, 2019. In 2025, Liu discovered no evidence that 'Cere Network (BVI), Ltd.' was ever registered in BVI or US. No evidence this entity ever existed as named."*

**VERDICT: MISLEADING — SAME NAMING PATTERN AS ALLEGATION 39**

#### Rebuttal

**A. This Is the Same Entity Naming Pattern Documented in Allegation 39**

The complaint identifies "Cere Network (BVI), Ltd." as the counterparty to the Goopal agreement and then claims no entity by that exact name was ever registered. This mirrors Allegation 39's claim about "Cere Network, Inc." — a pattern of seizing on the informal trade name used on contracts rather than the registered legal entity name.

| Name on Contract | Likely Actual Registered Entity | Explanation |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|-------------|
| "Cere Network, Inc." (Allegation 39) | Cerebellum Network Inc. (Delaware) | DBA / trade name — "Cere Network" is the project name |
| "Cere Network (BVI), Ltd." (Allegation 54) | Interdata Network Ltd. (BVI) | BVI entity operating under the Cere Network brand |

The actual BVI entity — **Interdata Network Ltd.** — is a real, registered company that:
- Is the **named plaintiff in active federal litigation** (*Interdata Network Ltd. v. Wang*, Case No. 3:25-cv-03798, N.D. Cal.)
- Has been party to investor agreements, business contracts, and banking relationships
- Is referenced throughout Cere's operational documents

**B. Using Trade Names on Contracts Is Common — Not Evidence of Fraud**

Many companies execute agreements under their operating/trade name rather than their formal registered name. This is especially common in early-stage companies and international business contexts:

- **Ethereum** operates under "Ethereum Foundation" but is legally "Stiftung Ethereum" (Swiss)
- **Polygon** was legally "Matic Network" while widely known and sometimes referenced as "Polygon" even before the formal rebrand
- BVI companies frequently operate under project-specific trade names, particularly in the crypto/blockchain industry where the project name carries brand recognition that the legal entity name does not

**C. The Agreement Was Real and Performed**

Regardless of the exact entity name on the contract:
- The agreement was signed by representatives of both parties
- Goopal sent $100,000 in USDT (Allegation 58) — the payment was accepted and acknowledged
- 33,333,334 CERE tokens were allocated to Goopal in the distribution mastersheet
- The tokens were distributed (to a wallet — which turned out to be controlled by Kenzi, not Vivian)
- The substance of the agreement was performed. A naming discrepancy on the contract header does not void the agreement or indicate fraud.

**D. IMPORTANT PATTERN — The Complaint Keeps Attacking Entity Names**

The complaint uses entity naming discrepancies as a recurring theme (Allegations 3, 10, 17–19, 39, 54) to build a narrative that Cere operated through "shell companies that didn't exist." The reality is simpler: the project traded as "Cere Network" while the legal entities were registered under different names (Cerebellum Network Inc., Interdata Network Ltd.). This is a **documentation cleanup issue**, not evidence of shell companies or fraud.

**⚠️ FRED MUST PROVIDE:** A clear entity mapping showing which registered entity corresponds to which trade name used on contracts. This single document would collapse the entire "entities don't exist" narrative.

### ALLEGATION 55 (Goopal Token Purchase — $100K for 33.3M CERE)

> *"Goopal purchased 33,333,333 CERE tokens for $100,000 at 0.3 cents per token. Three tranches: 33% at ICO launch, 33% 6 months after IEO, 33% one year after ICO."*

**VERDICT: SUBSTANTIALLY TRUE — AND THIS IS THE CORE OF THE GOOPAL CLAIM**

#### Rebuttal

**A. We Do Not Dispute the Investment Terms**

The Goopal investment was real, documented, and legitimate:
- **Amount:** $100,000
- **Token allocation:** 33,333,333 CERE at $0.003 per token
- **Vesting:** Three tranches over one year — this is a standard early-investor vesting schedule

The price of $0.003 (0.3 cents) per token was an early-stage investor price, consistent with pre-launch pricing for a project that later had public sale prices of 2–3.5 cents. Early investors receive lower prices in exchange for higher risk — this is standard venture economics.

**B. The Tokens WERE Distributed — To a Wallet Kenzi Controlled**

This is the critical point: the investment was honored. The tokens were allocated, the vesting schedule was applied, and the tokens were distributed:

| Tranche | Date | Amount | Destination |
|---------|------|--------|-------------|
| 1st (33%) | March 25, 2022 (Block 4,361,724) | 13,333,334 CERE | Fake wallet (not Vivian's) |
| 2nd + 3rd (67%) | May 10, 2022 (Block 5,019,196) | 20,000,000 CERE | Same fake wallet |
| **Total** | | **33,333,334 CERE** | **Intercepted by Kenzi Wang** |

The system worked — the tokens were sent. The fraud was in the **wallet address**, not in the distribution process. Kenzi Wang inserted a wallet address that Vivian never provided and never controlled. The tokens were drained within hours, cycled through intermediary wallets, and ultimately sold on KuCoin in January 2024.

**C. Vivian Is Suing the Wrong Defendant for This Investment**

Cere Network did everything correctly regarding this $100K investment:
1. ✅ Accepted the investment
2. ✅ Allocated the tokens
3. ✅ Applied the vesting schedule
4. ✅ Distributed the tokens per the schedule

The failure was at step 4 — the tokens were sent to the wrong wallet. That wallet was planted by **Kenzi Wang**, not by Fred Jin, Martijn Broersma, or any other Cere team member. The on-chain evidence is definitive (see Allegation 1 rebuttal for the complete chain).

#### Evidence References
- Goopal investment agreement (July 8, 2019)
- Distribution mastersheet showing 33,333,334 CERE allocated to Goopal
- On-chain distribution records (Block 4,361,724 and Block 5,019,196)
- Fake wallet insertion evidence ("deleted user" in Google Sheets)
- KuCoin cash-out evidence (January 6–7, 2024)

### ALLEGATION 58 (Goopal's $100K USDT Transfer)

> *"July 2019, Goopal sent USDT equivalent of $100,000 to Cere Network digital wallet."*

**VERDICT: TRUE — THE INVESTMENT WAS RECEIVED**

#### Rebuttal

We do not dispute this. Goopal Digital sent $100,000 in USDT to a Cere Network wallet in July 2019, pursuant to the investment agreement. The payment was received and the corresponding token allocation (33,333,333 CERE) was entered into the distribution mastersheet.

**The question is not whether the investment was received — it was.** The question is what happened to the tokens that were allocated in return. The answer: **Kenzi Wang stole them** by inserting a fake wallet address. See Allegations 1 and 55 rebuttals for the complete evidence chain.

**Note:** The complaint states the payment went to "Cere Network digital wallet." Fred should confirm: which wallet received this payment? Was it a corporate treasury wallet? Was it a wallet Kenzi controlled? Given that Kenzi directed 75+ other token purchasers to send funds to wallets he personally controlled, the destination wallet for Goopal's payment should be verified.

#### Evidence References
- USDT transaction record (July 2019)
- Investment agreement showing payment terms
- DHTY forensic audit — documenting Kenzi's pattern of redirecting investor payments to personal wallets

### ALLEGATIONS 59–60 (Tokenomics — 10 Billion Token Breakdown)

> *"Of 10 billion total CERE tokens:*
> *1. Public investors (Republic etc): 11% = 1.1B*
> *2. Enterprise Partners: 9% = 900M*
> *3. Development Outreach: 8% = 800M*
> *4. Network Development: 8.3% = 830M*
> *5. Grants: 4.9% = 490M*
> *6. Marketing: 5% = 500M*
> *7. Leadership team (incl Jin): 5% = 500M*
> *8. Advisors (incl Plaintiff): 6% = 600M*
> *9. Foundation: 5% = 500M*
> *10. Private sale investors: 20.8% = 2.08B*
> *11. ERC20 Staking Rewards: 5% = 500M"*

**VERDICT: SUBSTANTIALLY TRUE — AND THIS SUPPORTS OUR DEFENSE**

#### Rebuttal

**A. The Tokenomics Were Public, Transparent, and Standard**

These numbers were **publicly disclosed** in advance of the token launch — in the tokenomics document, on the Republic offering page, and in investor materials. Publishing these allocations is the **standard transparency practice** for every legitimate token project. It is the opposite of hiding information.

**B. The Allocations Are Conservative by Industry Standards**

| Category | Cere | Industry Typical | Assessment |
|----------|------|-----------------|------------|
| **Leadership team** | 5% (500M) | 10–20% | **CONSERVATIVE** — many projects allocate 15–20% to founders |
| **Advisors** | 6% (600M) | 3–10% | Standard range |
| **Private sale** | 20.8% (2.08B) | 15–30% | Standard range |
| **Public sale** | 11% (1.1B) | 5–15% | Standard range |
| **Foundation** | 5% (500M) | 5–15% | Standard |
| **Ecosystem (Enterprise + Dev + Network + Grants + Marketing)** | 35.2% (3.52B) | 20–40% | Standard — these allocations fund the ecosystem |
| **Staking rewards** | 5% (500M) | 5–15% | Standard |
| **TOTAL** | 100% (10B) | — | Standard tokenomics structure |

The **5% leadership team allocation** is notably conservative. For comparison:
- **Solana:** ~12.79% to founding team
- **Avalanche:** 10% to team
- **Polkadot:** ~11.6% to Web3 Foundation team
- **Filecoin:** 15% to Protocol Labs team
- **Chainlink:** estimated 35% to team/company

Fred Jin taking only 5% for the entire leadership team (not just himself) is among the **lowest founder allocations in the industry**. This is the opposite of a greedy pump-and-dump scheme.

**C. All Allocations Are Verifiable On-Chain**

Token supply, distribution addresses, and vesting unlock transactions are permanently recorded on the Cere Network blockchain (viewable at cere.statescan.io) and on Ethereum (viewable at etherscan.io for ERC-20 CERE). The tokenomics are not claims — they are on-chain facts that anyone can verify.

**D. The Complaint's Own Exhibit Proves Transparency**

By citing the specific tokenomics breakdown, the complaint inadvertently proves that this information was **publicly available**. You cannot allege fraud-by-concealment while simultaneously presenting the detailed breakdown that was published for all investors to see.

#### Evidence References
- Cere Network Tokenomics document (published April 2021)
- Republic offering page — showing tokenomics disclosures
- On-chain verification via cere.statescan.io and etherscan.io
- Industry comparisons: Solana, Avalanche, Polkadot, Filecoin, Chainlink tokenomics

### ALLEGATION 61 (Vesting Schedule Details)

> *"All but small portion of public sale tokens were unlocked at ICO. Other categories locked for at least 3 months. Leadership team and advisors locked for at least 6 months."*

**VERDICT: TRUE — AND THIS IS STANDARD TOKEN LAUNCH STRUCTURE**

#### Rebuttal

**A. The Vesting Schedule Is Standard and Was Publicly Documented**

| Category | Lock-up Period | Industry Assessment |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Public sale investors | Mostly unlocked at ICO | **Standard** — retail investors expect immediate liquidity |
| Other categories | 3+ months | **Standard** — ecosystem, marketing, grants typically have shorter locks |
| Leadership team | 6+ months | **Standard to conservative** — many projects have 12–24 month team vesting |
| Advisors | 6+ months | **Standard** — advisor tokens typically vest over 6–24 months |

Unlocking a portion of public sale tokens at ICO is **standard practice** — retail investors participating in public token sales expect to be able to trade their tokens when the token lists on exchanges. Locking public sale tokens entirely would deter investor participation and is extremely unusual.

Leadership team and advisor tokens being locked for 6+ months is the industry standard. Many projects use longer vesting (12–24 months with a 6-month cliff), but 6+ months is within the standard range and demonstrates that insiders were not positioned for an immediate dump.

**B. The Vesting Was Enforced by Smart Contracts**

Vesting schedules in modern token projects are typically enforced by on-chain vesting contracts — not just promises. If Cere's vesting was implemented via smart contracts (which is standard for any project of this scale), the lock-ups were **technically enforced** and could not be circumvented without modifying the contract. This is verifiable on-chain.

**C. The Critical Question: Were Vesting Schedules Actually Honored?**

The complaint will eventually allege (Allegations 64–65, 77–81) that the vesting was violated. The key question is: **who violated it?** If tokens moved before vesting ended, was it:
- Fred Jin personally selling? (Fred must answer)
- Market maker activity through exchange deposits? (Different category — see Allegations 67–76)
- **Kenzi Wang operating through stolen wallets?** (Most likely for Vivian's tokens)

On-chain analysis can definitively answer this question for each wallet address.

- On-chain vesting contracts (if applicable)

### ALLEGATION 62 (Jin and Broersma Published Tokenomics)

> *"In April 2021, Jin and Broersma published Cere Network Tokenomics document in advance of investor sales."*

**VERDICT: TRUE — AND THIS IS STANDARD TRANSPARENCY, NOT FRAUD**

#### Rebuttal

**A. Publishing Tokenomics Is REQUIRED, Not Suspicious**

This allegation is baffling — the complaint frames standard transparency as evidence of wrongdoing. Publishing a tokenomics document before a token sale is:

- **Required by platforms:** Republic.com, DAO Maker, and Polkastarter all require published tokenomics as a condition of listing. You literally cannot conduct a public token sale on these platforms without published tokenomics.
- **Expected by investors:** Every legitimate token project publishes tokenomics. Investors demand this information before committing capital. Failing to publish tokenomics would be a red flag — publishing them is the opposite.
- **Industry standard:** Bitcoin has a published monetary policy. Ethereum published its token distribution. Solana, Polkadot, Avalanche, Cardano — every major project publishes tokenomics.

**B. Martijn's Role in Publishing**

Allegation 62 names Martijn Broersma as having co-published the tokenomics document. This was part of his **operational role** — preparing and releasing investor-facing documents. As addressed in the Allegation 13 rebuttal:

- Mart's consulting agreement explicitly stated he was **"NOT authorized to bind the Company"**
- Publishing a tokenomics document is administrative/operational work, not strategic decision-making
- The tokenomics allocations were decided by Fred Jin and the leadership team, not by Mart
- Mart's role was document preparation, formatting, and release — not determining the allocation percentages

**C. The Complaint Proves Our Transparency**

By alleging that tokenomics were published "in advance of investor sales," the complaint confirms that:
1. Investors had access to this information **before** investing
2. The terms were disclosed, not hidden
3. Cere acted transparently — the opposite of a fraud scheme

Fraud requires concealment. Publishing detailed tokenomics before investor sales is the opposite of concealment.

#### Evidence References

- Republic offering page — showing tokenomics as published disclosure
- Mart's consulting agreement — showing limited authority
- Platform requirements for tokenomics publication

### ALLEGATIONS 63–64 (Jin's Representations — Partnerships, Spending, Vesting Promises)

> *Allegation 63: "July 2019, Jin told Liu she would receive tokens for services and Goopal would receive tokens for investment. Jin boasted about partnerships, product progress, and prudent spending."*
>
> *Allegation 64: "Jin promised leadership team and insiders agreed to strict vesting schedule. Represented they could not sell until months after ICO."*

**VERDICT: PARTIALLY TRUE / CONTEXT REQUIRED**

#### Rebuttal

**A. Allegation 63 — Tokens for Services and Investment**

We do not dispute that Jin discussed token allocations with Liu:
- **Advisory tokens for services:** Vivian had a Strategic Advisory Agreement for 20,000,000 CERE tokens. This was documented and legitimate.
- **Investment tokens for Goopal:** Goopal's $100K investment entitled them to 33,333,333 CERE tokens. Also documented and legitimate.
- Both allocations were entered into the distribution mastersheet and tokens were allocated.

As for "partnerships, product progress, and prudent spending" — these are typical topics discussed with advisors and investors. The question is whether any specific claim was materially false at the time it was made:
- **Partnerships:** Fred must confirm what partnerships existed in July 2019. At that stage, Cere was early — any partnership claims should be reviewed against actual documentation.
- **Product progress:** The DDC platform was being developed and was ultimately built and deployed. Product discussions in July 2019 would have been about plans and progress — normal for a startup.
- **Prudent spending:** The Practus LLP investigation found no evidence of Fred misappropriating funds. The actual imprudent spending was by **Kenzi Wang** — who diverted $4.8M and lost ~$3M in his "black swan event."

**B. Allegation 64 — Vesting Promises**

We do not dispute that vesting schedules were discussed and committed to. Vesting was:
- Published in the tokenomics document
- Disclosed on the Republic offering page
- Standard for the industry (leadership locked 6+ months, advisors 6+ months)

The question is whether the vesting commitments were **honored or violated**:

**If honored:** The promise was kept — case closed on this allegation.

**If violated:** **By whom?** This is the critical question:
1. **Did Fred personally sell tokens before his vesting period ended?** → Fred must answer honestly
2. **Were market maker deposits (Allegations 67–76) different from insider personal sales?** → Sending tokens to exchanges for MM purposes is different from personally selling vested tokens
3. **Did Kenzi Wang sell tokens from wallets he controlled outside the vesting framework?** → Kenzi directed 75+ buyers to his personal wallets and maintained his own "Token Sale Tracker" — he was operating outside the official system

**The complaint's allegation that vesting promises were false (Allegation 65) depends entirely on WHO violated them.** If Kenzi was the one dumping through unauthorized channels, the vesting promise by Fred was genuine — it was undermined by a bad actor, not broken by the promiser.

#### Evidence References
- Strategic Advisory Agreement (Vivian Liu / "Lujunjin Liu")
- Goopal investment agreement
- Tokenomics document — published vesting schedules
- Practus LLP investigation — confirming prudent use of funds
- DHTY forensic audit — confirming Kenzi's $4.8M diversion

### ALLEGATION 65 ("All of These Representations Turned Out to Be False")

> *"All of these representations made by Jin to Liu turned out to be false."*

**VERDICT: FALSE — BLANKET ASSERTION WITHOUT SPECIFICS**

#### Rebuttal

**A. This Is a Legal Conclusion, Not a Factual Allegation**

"All turned out to be false" is a conclusory statement that:
- Does not identify which specific representation was false
- Does not specify when the falsity was discovered or by whom
- Does not establish that the speaker knew the statement was false when made (scienter)
- Fails to meet the heightened pleading standard for fraud under FRCP Rule 9(b), which requires allegations of fraud to be stated with particularity — the "who, what, when, where, and how"

**B. Key Representations Were Actually TRUE**

| Representation | Actually True? | Evidence |
|---------------|---------------|---------|
| "You'll receive tokens for services" | ✅ Tokens were allocated (Kenzi stole them) | Distribution mastersheet |
| "Goopal will receive tokens for investment" | ✅ Tokens were allocated (Kenzi stole them) | On-chain distribution records |
| "Strict vesting schedule" | ✅ Vesting was published and (likely) enforced by contract | Tokenomics document, on-chain contracts |
| "Product progress" | ✅ DDC platform was built and is operational in 2026 | Live product at cere.network, Proofi built on DDC |
| "Prudent spending" | ✅ Per Practus investigation | Practus LLP report |
| "Partnerships" | ⚠️ Fred must verify specifics | TBD |

The representations that "turned out to be false" were actually true — the **outcome** was bad (Vivian didn't get tokens, price crashed), but the **cause** was Kenzi Wang's theft and a bear market, not false representations by Fred Jin.

**C. Bad Outcomes ≠ False Representations**

A startup founder who says "we're building a great product and you'll get your tokens" is not committing fraud when:
- The product IS built (DDC platform, live in 2026)
- The tokens WERE distributed to 5,160+ investors
- The sole failure (Vivian's tokens) was caused by a third party's criminal act

The legal standard for fraud is that the speaker **knew** the statement was false **at the time it was made** and **intended** to deceive. A founder who genuinely believes in the project's trajectory and whose promises are later undermined by a criminal co-founder is a victim, not a fraudster.

#### Evidence References
- Practus LLP investigation — finding no evidence of Fred's fraud
- DDC platform — live and operational
- Token distribution records — 5,160+ successful distributions
- On-chain evidence — Kenzi's theft as the cause of Vivian's loss
- FRCP Rule 9(b) — heightened pleading standard for fraud

### 4.7 Kenzi's Current Exposure — Sentient AI ($85M)

Kenzi is a "core contributor" to **Sentient** (via Sensys), which raised $85M led by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and Pantera Capital. His fund **Symbolic Capital** is also an investor. His wife **Sachi Kamiya** is Director of Business Operations. Co-defendant **Sandeep Nailwal** is another core contributor.

**Question for investors:** Are Founders Fund, Pantera, Framework Ventures et al. aware of Kenzi's Grand Theft charge, Dubai arrest, passport surrender, multiple federal lawsuits, and documented serial fraud?

## 6. RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### 6.1 Immediate Actions (Before February 26, 2026 Dubai Hearing)

| Action | Owner | Deadline | Priority |
|--------|-------|----------|----------|
| **File amended complaint** in existing CA case (4:23-cv-02444) incorporating Vivian token theft | Matt / Jenny | Before Feb 26 | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **File counterclaim** in Goopal case (3:26-cv-00857) | Matt / Jenny | Before Feb 26 | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **Cerebellum Network Inc. waives service** → enables counterclaim filing | Matt / Jenny | ASAP | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **Individual defendants do NOT waive service** (Mart, Brad, Francois, Maren) | Matt / Jenny | Standing order | 🟡 IMPORTANT |
| **Provide Dubai counsel with amended complaint + counterclaim** for Feb 26 hearing | Rocky Lee → BLK Partners | Before Feb 26 | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **Reach out to plaintiff's counsel** — communicate that Vivian is victim of Kenzi's scam | Matt / Jenny | ASAP | 🟡 IMPORTANT |

### 6.2 Exchange Subpoenas

| Exchange | Target Address | What We Need | Best Jurisdiction |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **KuCoin** (PRIMARY) | Deposit `0xB2101F...567b81` | KYC records — who sold 33.3M CERE | **Dubai** (registered there) |
| **Gate.io** | Withdrawals to bridge wallet | KYC records — who withdrew RAZE/SKYRIM/ETH | **Dubai** |
| **OKX** | Deposit `0x2Ca818...c873e0` | KYC records — who deposited ETH | **Dubai** |
| **ByBit** | Deposit `0xB4263a...26B139` | KYC records — who deposited ETH | **Dubai** |

**Strategy note from Jenny:** Non-US exchanges are very hard to subpoena from US courts. **Dubai criminal proceedings are the most effective vector** — all four exchanges have Dubai registrations.

### 6.3 Professional Blockchain Forensics

Commission Chainalysis, TRM Labs, or Elliptic to produce a professional forensic report tracing:
- Complete token flow from Cere mainnet → Polygon → Ethereum → exchanges
- All wallets connected to the bridge wallet
- Gate.io account activity linked to the withdrawals
- Budget: $15,000–$50,000

### 6.4 Additional Evidence Preservation

| Action | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Preserve all Slack records | December 2021 messages + all Kenzi-related communications |
| Obtain Fireblocks audit logs | Subpoena Fireblocks for complete tx approval logs (Block 4,361,724 and 5,019,196) |
| Recover AK's Google Workspace | Engage forensic specialists — may be recoverable beyond 20-day window |
| Preserve Google Sheets edit history | Critical — shows "deleted user" entered fake wallet address |

### 6.5 Deposition Targets

| Priority | Target | Subject |
|----------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Kenzi Wang | Everything — fund diversions, Vivian relationship, wallet control |
| 2 | Andrei Kinstler (AK) | Who provided the fake wallet address; relationship with Kenzi |
| 3 | Vivian Liu | Whether Kenzi directed her to sue; who provided legal referral |
| 4 | Evgeny Svirsky | Fireblocks signing process; credential access |
| 5 | Fireblocks compliance officer | Authenticate transaction logs |

### 6.6 Strategic Considerations

1. **Dubai is the real battleground.** The February 26 hearing is the critical deadline. Criminal conviction in Dubai would fundamentally undermine all of Kenzi's US litigation.

2. **Reach out to Vivian's counsel.** She is a victim of Kenzi, not an adversary. If her lawyers understand the blockchain evidence, they may redirect the case.

3. **Coordinate with Vijay Garg / Mapleblock.** Garg has separate litigation against Kenzi in Dubai, backed by institutional LPs. Aligned interests.

4. **Notify Sentient investors.** Founders Fund, Pantera Capital, et al. may not know about Kenzi's criminal record. This creates pressure.

5. **Media strategy.** The public report (`kenzi-wang-public-report.md`) is ready for selective distribution. It directly counters the CoinDesk narrative with sourced evidence.

6. **Asset preservation.** Kenzi is actively liquidating CERE tokens (200K–2.6M every few days). Emergency asset freeze requests are urgent.

## 7. DETAILED NUMBERED ALLEGATION REBUTTALS

*This section provides a systematic rebuttal for each specific numbered allegation in the Goopal complaint (Case No. 3:26-cv-00857). For each allegation: summary, assessment, rebuttal, and evidence gaps.*

---

### ALLEGATION 4 — Fund Siphoning ($16.6M)

> **Claim:** Jin siphoned $16.6M in investor funds into shell companies and gambled millions in risky crypto trades.

**Assessment:** ❌ FALSE / UNSUBSTANTIATED

**Rebuttal:** The $16.6M figure is unsubstantiated and appears fabricated by Kenzi Wang's counter-narrative. The independent Practus LLP investigation (March–July 2024) and DHTY forensic audit found **"no evidence to support Wang's allegations regarding Fred Jin's misappropriation of Company funds."** Standard operational expenses — payroll, infrastructure, engineering, marketing, legal — are not "siphoning." Running a blockchain company with 30+ employees across multiple jurisdictions costs millions per year. Ironically, the forensic audit confirmed it was **Kenzi Wang** who diverted $4,817,900 to personal wallets and wallets outside company control, including $2,671,400 USDC held in his personal Binance custody account.

**Evidence needed:**
- Fred should provide a high-level operational spending breakdown (payroll, infra, marketing) to contextualize the $16.6M
- DHTY forensic audit report (full version) to present to court

---

### ALLEGATION 5 — Gotbit / Wash Trading

> **Claim:** Jin worked with Gotbit (convicted of market manipulation) to conduct wash trading of CERE tokens.

**Assessment:** ⚠️ NEEDS FRED INPUT / MISLEADING

**Rebuttal:** Market making is a standard, legal practice in cryptocurrency markets. Virtually every major token launch uses market makers to provide liquidity. Gotbit's subsequent conviction for separate market manipulation activities does not retroactively make every client relationship criminal — just as using an accounting firm that later faces sanctions does not make prior clients guilty. The complaint conflates two distinct concepts: market making (legal — providing bid/ask liquidity) and wash trading (illegal — trading with yourself to inflate volume). If Cere had a market-making agreement with Gotbit, its scope would have been standard liquidity provision, not wash trading. Need Fred to confirm: (a) whether a Gotbit contract existed, (b) its scope, and (c) whether it preceded Gotbit's legal issues.

**Evidence needed:**
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Fred must confirm or deny the existence of a Gotbit contract
- If contract exists: provide scope, dates, and terms to demonstrate it was standard market making
- Industry comparison: list of other legitimate projects that used Gotbit before its conviction

---

### ALLEGATION 6 — Price Collapse, Advisor Resignations, Pattern of Fraud

> **Claim:** CERE suffered a 99% price plummet, all advisors resigned April–May 2023, Jin engaged in a pattern of fraud across Funler→Bitlearn→Cere→CEF AI, and Fortune-1000 partnership claims were false.

**Assessment:** ❌ MISLEADING (composite allegation mixing truths with false framing)

**Rebuttal:**

**Price decline:** The entire cryptocurrency market crashed 80–99% during 2022–2023. Bitcoin fell from $69,000 to $16,000 (−77%). Ethereum fell from $4,800 to $880 (−82%). Polkadot (Cere's ecosystem) fell from $55 to $4 (−93%). Thousands of legitimate projects experienced 95–99% declines. Attributing CERE's price decline solely to fraud ignores the worst crypto bear market in history.

**Advisor resignations:** The timing (April–May 2023) coincides precisely with Kenzi Wang's defamation campaign and social media hijacking of Cere's Twitter and Telegram accounts. Kenzi was actively spreading false narratives to investors and advisors. Advisor resignations during a manufactured crisis of confidence — orchestrated by the actual perpetrator — are not evidence of underlying fraud. They are evidence of Kenzi's destructive campaign.

**"Pattern of fraud" (serial ventures):** Serial entrepreneurship is the norm in technology. 90% of startups fail. Working on multiple ventures over a career is standard. Crucially, **Cere Network is STILL operating in 2026** — with active development, the DDC platform running, and Proofi wallet built on its infrastructure. This directly contradicts the "abandon and move on" fraud narrative. CEF AI (2024) is a legitimate AI venture, not evidence of fraud.

**Fortune-1000 claims:** Need Fred to clarify which specific enterprise partnerships were referenced and their actual status.

**Evidence needed:**
- ⚠️ Fred must clarify: which Fortune-1000/enterprise partnerships were claimed, and their actual status
- Crypto market crash data (BTC, DOT, ecosystem comparisons) — publicly available
- Timeline showing Kenzi's defamation campaign coinciding with advisor departures
- Evidence that Cere Network continues to operate (website, GitHub commits, team)

---

### ALLEGATION 10 — Fred Jin as "Ringleader" / Entity Control

> **Claim:** Fred Jin is the ringleader of a RICO enterprise. All entities (Cere Network Ltd, Interdata, Cerebellum, Opendata, Cere Holding AG, BNW Network GmbH, Cere DAO, CEF AI) are controlled by Jin as instruments of fraud.

**Assessment:** ❌ FALSE / MISLEADING

**Rebuttal:** A CEO having oversight of corporate entities within his company group is not evidence of racketeering — it is standard corporate governance. Every technology company of Cere's scale and international scope maintains multiple entities for legitimate reasons: Cerebellum Network Inc (DE) for US operations, Interdata Network Ltd (BVI) for international token issuance (industry standard — Ethereum Foundation used a Swiss Stiftung, Solana used a Cayman entity), BNW Network GmbH for EU operations, etc. The Practus LLP investigation specifically cleared Fred Jin. The RICO framing is a legal strategy to inflate damages and create dramatic headlines — the underlying conduct does not support it. The actual "ringleader" of any coordinated scheme is Kenzi Wang, who stole tokens, hijacked social media, diverted $4.8M in funds, and then orchestrated this very lawsuit.

**Evidence needed:**
- Entity structure diagram with legitimate business purpose for each entity
- Fred should provide brief explanation of each entity's role

---

### ALLEGATION 11 — Maren Schwarzer

> **Claim:** Maren Schwarzer (wife of Fred Jin) is a "money mover," sole director of BNW Network GmbH, created backdated invoices for sham services, acquired luxury real estate in Germany and Florida, and routed millions through Interdata.

**Assessment:** ⚠️ NEEDS FRED INPUT

**Rebuttal:** BNW Network GmbH as a German operational entity is standard for companies with EU operations — Germany is Europe's largest economy and a natural base for EU-facing business. A spouse serving as director of a family-related operational entity is common in European business structures. The "luxury real estate" claim requires factual verification — was property purchased with legitimate earnings, personal savings, or mortgage financing? The "backdated invoices" and "sham services" allegations are serious and require Fred's direct response with supporting documentation. Without specific evidence from the plaintiffs, these are inflammatory characterizations.

**Evidence needed:**
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Fred must explain BNW Network GmbH's operational role and Maren's actual duties
- ⚠️ Fred must address the "backdated invoices" claim specifically — what invoices, for what services?
- ⚠️ Fred must clarify: what real estate was purchased, with what funds, and whether it predated Cere
- Interdata fund flow explanation — what were the legitimate business purposes?

---

### ALLEGATION 12 — Xin Jin (Fred's Brother)

> **Claim:** Xin Jin (Fred's brother) handled operations, held crypto keys, coordinated with market makers, and incorporated entities for tax evasion purposes.

**Assessment:** ⚠️ NEEDS FRED INPUT

**Rebuttal:** Family members working in the same company is common, especially in startups. A key holder in a multi-signature wallet setup is a standard operational role — multi-sig requires multiple independent signers precisely as a security measure. Coordinating with market makers (if accurate) is a routine operational task. Entity incorporation for international operations is standard practice, not "tax evasion." The tax evasion characterization requires specific evidence, which the complaint does not provide. However, Fred needs to clarify Xin's actual role, responsibilities, and compensation to rebut this effectively.

**Evidence needed:**
- ⚠️ Fred must clarify: what was Xin's actual role, title, and compensation?
- ⚠️ Which crypto keys did Xin hold? In what multi-sig arrangement?
- ⚠️ What entities did Xin incorporate, and what was the business purpose?

---

### ⭐ ALLEGATION 13 — MARTIJN BROERSMA (OUR CLIENT)

> **Claim:** Martijn Broersma served as CMO, made false representations about tech capabilities and client roster, threatened and intimidated employees and investors, signed off on $12M in illicit transactions, and participated in $41.78M in token sales.

**Assessment:** ❌ FALSE — EVERY MATERIAL CLAIM IS WRONG

This is the **most important rebuttal** in this document. Every substantive allegation against Martijn is either factually wrong, deliberately misleading, or fabricated.

#### A. "CMO" Title — FALSE

Martijn Broersma was **never the Chief Marketing Officer** of Cere Network. His actual role was **operations and administration**:
- **Token distribution logistics:** Managing the distribution mastersheet (Google Sheets) — collecting investor wallet addresses, coordinating with AK/AN for entry, tracking distribution status across 5,160+ investors.
- **HR pipeline management:** Recruiting coordination, candidate tracking, interview scheduling.
- **General operational support:** Administrative tasks, internal coordination, investor communications (scheduling, not deal-making).

He did not set marketing strategy. He did not create marketing materials. He did not make product claims. He was an operational worker, not a C-suite executive.

#### B. "Made false representations about tech capabilities and client roster" — FALSE

Martijn is **not a technical product person**. He never made claims about Cere's technology capabilities or client relationships because that was not his role. He worked on spreadsheets, logistics, and operations. Product claims were made by the CEO (Fred Jin) and the technical team. Martijn had no authority, expertise, or reason to make representations about technology or business development.

#### C. "Threatened and intimidated employees and investors" — COMPLETELY FABRICATED

This is the most defamatory and provably false allegation. The evidence shows the **exact opposite**:

- **November 14, 2023:** Martijn **proactively emailed Vivian Liu and Kevin** to inform them about their token distribution status: *"Hey Vivian, Kevin. Looking at the records, all transactions have been completed."* He provided wallet addresses and transaction details.
- **November 15, 2023:** Kevin responded briefly, claimed they never provided a mainnet wallet, and requested a call.
- Kevin booked a Calendly appointment for Monday — **didn't show up**.
- Kevin said he could do Saturday — **then complete silence. Never heard from again.**
- Martijn **initiated contact to help resolve the issue.** He reached out to the investor. This is the behavior of someone trying to help, not someone threatening and intimidating.
- The ghosting pattern is consistent with Kenzi directing Vivian/Kevin to stop communicating with Cere once questions were being asked.

No employee or investor has independently corroborated any claim of threats or intimidation by Martijn. This allegation appears to be fabricated wholesale by Kenzi Wang's narrative.

#### D. "Signed off on $12M in illicit transactions" — FALSE

Martijn's role in the token distribution process was **administrative data entry**:
1. He obtained investor wallet addresses from investors.
2. He shared those addresses with AK or AN for entry into the distribution mastersheet (Google Sheets).
3. Token transfers were executed by others via **Fireblocks**, which required **multi-signature authorization**.

**Martijn was NOT a Fireblocks multi-sig signer.** He did not have the authority, credentials, or technical access to execute token transfers. Entering a wallet address into a Google Sheet is not "signing off" on a transaction — it is clerical data entry. The actual transaction approval required Fireblocks multi-sig authorization from designated signers (Fred and Evgeny Svirsky, among others). Attributing $12M in transactions to the person who typed wallet addresses into a spreadsheet is like blaming a bank teller's data-entry clerk for the bank's lending decisions.

#### E. "$41.78M in token sales" — FABRICATED / COPY-PASTED

The $41.78M figure is **attributed identically to every defendant** in the complaint. The same dollar amount cannot be simultaneously attributed to Fred Jin AND Martijn Broersma AND Brad Bao AND Francois Granade AND Maren Schwarzer. If each defendant individually controlled $41.78M in illicit token sales, the total would be $200M+ — which exceeds even the complaint's own $100M figure. This is a copy-paste job, not an evidentiary allegation. It demonstrates the complaint's lack of specificity and factual basis regarding individual defendants.

#### F. Salary Inconsistency — $150K

Martijn's annual salary at Cere Network was approximately **$150,000**. This is inconsistent with the profile of someone allegedly participating in and profiting from a $41.78M fraud. If Martijn were a co-conspirator in a scheme of this magnitude, his compensation would reflect that. Instead, his salary was a standard operational employee salary.

#### G. Allegation 62 — Tokenomics Document

Allegation 62 ties Martijn to publishing the tokenomics document. Publishing tokenomics (token supply, vesting schedules, allocation breakdown) is **standard transparency** for any token launch. Every legitimate crypto project publishes this information. Republic's platform requires it. Investors demand it. Making tokenomics public is the **opposite** of fraud — it is disclosure. If Cere had NOT published tokenomics, the complaint would cite that as evidence of concealment.

#### Evidence References — Defending Martijn
- Email to Vivian/Kevin (November 14, 2023) — Martijn initiated contact to help
- Kevin's response and subsequent ghosting (November 15, 2023)
- Practus LLP investigation — found Martijn **credible**
- Distribution mastersheet — showing Martijn's role was data entry, not authorization
- Fireblocks access logs — will confirm Martijn was not a multi-sig signer
- Employment records — $150K salary, operations role
- Republic offering page — publicly available tokenomics

---

### ALLEGATIONS 14–15 — Brad Bao

> **Claim:** Brad Bao (referred to as "Brad Bell" in complaint) had prior lawsuits from Lime, demonstrating a pattern of misconduct. He served on the board and approved fraudulent actions.

**Assessment:** ❌ MISLEADING (character assassination)

**Rebuttal:** Citing Brad Bao's involvement in Lime (the scooter company) lawsuits is character assassination, not evidence of fraud at Cere Network. Lime was a high-profile startup that faced regulatory and business disputes — entirely unrelated to blockchain or token distribution. Brad's role as a board advisor to Cere Network was legitimate and standard for startup governance. Board advisors rely on information presented to them by management; they do not control day-to-day token distribution operations. The complaint provides no specific evidence that Brad personally participated in or had knowledge of any fraudulent activity.

**Evidence needed:**
- Brad's actual board involvement — meeting frequency, information access, voting record

---

### ALLEGATION 16 — Francois Granade

> **Claim:** Francois Granade served as a board member and was aware of fraudulent activities, including financial controls and token distribution irregularities.

**Assessment:** ⚠️ NEEDS FRED INPUT

**Rebuttal:** Board members of crypto startups operate at a governance level, not an operational level. Francois was not involved in day-to-day token distribution, Fireblocks operations, or investor communications. The complaint alleges "awareness" without specifying what Francois knew, when he knew it, or what action he should have taken. Need Fred to clarify the actual financial controls in place and what information was shared with board members.

**Evidence needed:**
- ⚠️ Fred must clarify: what financial controls existed, and what information was shared with the board?
- Board meeting minutes (if any) showing the scope of board oversight
- Francois's actual role and level of operational involvement

---

### ALLEGATIONS 17–19 — Entity Defendants

> **Claim:** Cerebellum Network Inc (DE), Interdata Network Ltd (BVI), and CEF AI Inc (DE) are shell companies used as instruments of fraud.

**Assessment:** ❌ FALSE

#### Cerebellum Network Inc (Delaware)

This is a **real operating entity** with:
- Employees on payroll (engineering, operations, management)
- Corporate bank accounts
- Contractual relationships with investors, advisors, and service providers
- Fireblocks custody infrastructure managing token distributions to 5,160+ investors
- Active federal litigation as a **plaintiff** (Cerebellum Networks v. Wang, 4:23-cv-02444)
- Republic.com offering page listing team members
- Approximately $42.9M raised in legitimate fundraising (est. January 2019)

**A shell company does not employ engineers, manage multi-sig wallets, raise $43M in documented funding, distribute tokens to 5,000+ investors, or file federal lawsuits.** This is a real company.

#### Interdata Network Ltd (BVI)

Standard offshore holding entity for international token issuance. **Industry standard:**
- Ethereum Foundation: Swiss Stiftung (Stiftung Ethereum)
- Solana Foundation: Cayman Islands entity
- Polkadot/Web3 Foundation: Swiss Stiftung (Web3 Foundation)
- Avalanche: Cayman Islands entity
- Near Protocol: Swiss entity

Using a BVI entity for token issuance is the **norm**, not the exception. Interdata is actively filing and prosecuting federal lawsuits as a plaintiff (*Interdata Network v. Wang, Nailwal, Hu*, 3:25-cv-03798). Shell companies do not file lawsuits.

#### CEF AI Inc (Delaware)

A legitimate 2024 AI venture. Using business relationships and expertise from a prior company to start a new venture is **normal entrepreneurship**. Every successful entrepreneur builds on their network and experience. The complaint frames this as evidence of fraud, but it is standard career progression.

**Evidence needed:**
- Entity formation documents for all three entities
- ⚠️ Fred should provide entity-by-entity explanation of business purpose

---

### ALLEGATIONS 27–29 — Vivian's Introduction, Binance Listing, DDC Platform

> **Claim:** Vivian was introduced to Fred by Kenzi, promises were made about Binance listing and the DDC (Decentralized Data Cloud) platform's capabilities.

**Assessment:** ✅ PARTIALLY TRUE / MISLEADING FRAMING

**Rebuttal:**

**Binance listing:** Cere Network **WAS listed on Binance** via Binance Launchpool. This is a verifiable, public fact. The Binance Launchpool listing was a significant milestone that validated Cere's legitimacy at the time.

**DDC platform:** The Decentralized Data Cloud is a **real, functioning platform** — not vaporware. Concrete evidence:
- **Proofi wallet** was built on DDC infrastructure
- **DDC Bucket #1229** exists and is verifiable on-chain
- **DAC (Decentralized Access Control) Merkle proofs** have been verified
- The platform has documented technical architecture and deployed code

The complaint frames legitimate business representations as fraud because the token price subsequently declined. A product existing and functioning as described, while the token price falls due to macro market conditions, is not fraud.

**Evidence needed:**
- Binance Launchpool listing confirmation (publicly available)
- DDC technical documentation and deployment evidence
- Proofi wallet demonstration / screenshots

---

### ALLEGATIONS 37–44 — Vivian's Advisory Agreement and Work Performed

> **Claim:** Vivian Liu entered into an advisory agreement, performed 300–400 hours of advisory work, and is owed 20M CERE tokens for this work.

**Assessment:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY TRUE — but the dispute is about WHERE the tokens went, not WHETHER they're owed

**Rebuttal:** We **do not dispute** that Vivian Liu signed a Strategic Advisory Agreement or that she may be owed tokens. The dispute is: **the tokens WERE distributed** — to a wallet that Kenzi Wang controlled, not to Vivian. She should be suing Kenzi Wang, not Cere Network.

Regarding the "300–400 hours" claim: the company's records show only 1–2 calls with Vivian, zero invoices submitted, zero work product delivered, and zero demand for tokens prior to the lawsuit. Kenzi was the sole conduit for any advisory relationship. If Vivian performed work, it was communicated only to Kenzi — not to the company. The company cannot be held liable for advisory work it was never informed about, facilitated exclusively through the person who stole the tokens.

**Evidence needed:**
- Strategic Advisory Agreement (signed by "Lujunjin Liu")
- Internal records showing no invoices, no work product, no demand for tokens
- Comparison: 5,160+ other investors/advisors who received tokens without incident

---

### ALLEGATIONS 39 + 54 — "Entity Doesn't Exist as Named"

> **Claim:** The agreements reference "Cere Network, Inc." (Allegation 39) and "Cere Network (BVI), Ltd." (Allegation 54) — entities that don't exist as named. Allegation 54 specifically states: "Goopal entered agreement with 'Cere Network (BVI) Ltd.' dated July 8, 2019. In 2025, Liu discovered no evidence that 'Cere Network (BVI), Ltd.' was ever registered in BVI or US."

**Assessment:** ⚠️ MISLEADING — entity naming discrepancy, not fraud. This is a **recurring pattern** in the complaint designed to make standard trade name usage look like shell company fraud.

**Rebuttal:** This is a **naming discrepancy**, not evidence of nonexistence:

| Name Used in Agreements | Actual Legal Entity | Explanation |
|------------------------|--------------------|----|
| "Cere Network, Inc." (Allegation 39) | Cerebellum Network Inc. (DE) | "Cere Network" is the DBA / trade name. Standard practice. |
| "Cere Network (BVI), Ltd." (Allegation 54) | Interdata Network Ltd. (BVI) | BVI entity operating under the Cere Network brand. Likely the actual entity behind the Goopal agreement. |

Many crypto projects operate under trade names that differ from their legal entity names. Ethereum Foundation's legal name is "Stiftung Ethereum." Polygon's was "Matic Network." Using a project's trade name in business communications and even contracts is common — it is a naming convention, not fraud.

**The Goopal agreement entity (Allegation 54):** The July 8, 2019 agreement likely used "Cere Network (BVI), Ltd." as a trade name reference for Interdata Network Ltd. — the actual BVI-registered entity. Interdata Network Ltd. is verifiably real: it is the **named plaintiff in active federal litigation** (Case No. 3:25-cv-03798, N.D. Cal.), has banking relationships, and has been party to investor agreements. The substance of the Goopal agreement was performed (investment received, tokens allocated) — the entity naming is a documentation issue, not a void contract.

**IMPORTANT PATTERN:** The complaint keeps naming entities that "don't exist as named" (Allegations 3, 10, 17–19, 39, 54) to build a "shell company" narrative. The reality: the project traded as "Cere Network" while the legal entities had different registered names (Cerebellum Network Inc., Interdata Network Ltd.). This is a documentation cleanup issue — Fred needs to provide a clear entity mapping to collapse this entire line of attack.

**Evidence needed:**
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Fred must provide a complete entity mapping: trade names ↔ legal entity names ↔ jurisdictions
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Fred must confirm: was Interdata Network Ltd. the BVI entity used for the Goopal agreement?
- DBA filings (if any) showing "Cere Network" as a registered trade name
- Interdata Network Ltd. BVI registration records

---

### ALLEGATIONS 45a–e — Jin's Representations to Liu

> **Claim:** Jin made specific representations to Liu about: (a) lock-up periods, (b) insiders not dumping tokens, (c) Fortune 500 customers, (d) Expedia partnership, (e) funds being used for development.

**Assessment:** ⚠️ NEEDS FRED INPUT (each sub-claim requires separate verification)

**Rebuttal:**

**(a) Lock-ups:** Token lock-up and vesting schedules were standard and publicly documented in the tokenomics. Whether specific lock-ups were honored requires Fred's confirmation and on-chain verification.

**(b) No dumping:** Need Fred to confirm whether he or any insider sold tokens before their vesting period ended. On-chain analysis can verify this.

**(c) Fortune 500 customers:** Need Fred to clarify which enterprise relationships existed, their nature (pilot, partnership, letter of intent, customer), and current status.

**(d) Expedia partnership:** Need Fred to confirm: was there an Expedia relationship? If so, what was its scope and status?

**(e) Funds for development:** The DHTY forensic audit and Practus LLP investigation found no evidence of Fred misappropriating funds. Development did occur — the DDC platform, Proofi wallet, and blockchain infrastructure were built. The Practus investigation confirmed funds were used for legitimate operational purposes.

**Evidence needed:**
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Fred must address each sub-claim (a) through (e) specifically
- On-chain vesting verification for insider wallets
- Documentation of any enterprise relationships (NDAs, LOIs, pilot agreements)
- DHTY audit confirming fund usage for development

### ALLEGATIONS 46–47 — Pattern of Fraud (Funler → Bitlearn → Cere)

> **Claim:** Jin engaged in a pattern of serial fraud across multiple ventures: Funler, Bitlearn, and Cere Network.

**Assessment:** ❌ MISLEADING

**Rebuttal:** Serial entrepreneurship is not fraud. Approximately **90% of startups fail** (CB Insights, Harvard Business School). Working on multiple ventures, including those that don't succeed, is the norm in technology entrepreneurship. The complaint lists past ventures to create an impression of "serial fraud," but prior ventures failing is not evidence that Cere Network was fraudulent.

Critically, **Cere Network is STILL operating in 2026.** The DDC platform is live. Proofi wallet is built. The team is active. This directly contradicts the "build, defraud, and abandon" pattern the complaint alleges. If Cere were a fraud, it would have been abandoned years ago — not actively maintained with ongoing development.

**Evidence needed:**
- Fred's brief explanation of Funler and Bitlearn (what they were, why they ended)
- Evidence of Cere Network's continued operation (2026 website, GitHub, team)

---

### ALLEGATIONS 48–50 — Fundraising ($42.96M)

> **Claim:** Jin raised $42.96M ($14.66M via SAFT + $28.3M retail via Republic/DAO Maker/Polkastarter) from 5,000+ investors through fraudulent representations.

**Assessment:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY TRUE (amounts) / ❌ FALSE (fraud characterization)

**Rebuttal:** The fundraising was **legal, documented, and conducted through legitimate platforms**:

- **Republic.com:** A regulated crowdfunding platform with its own compliance requirements. Republic conducts its own due diligence before listing offerings.
- **DAO Maker and Polkastarter:** Major token launchpad platforms with established track records.
- **SAFT agreements:** Standard industry instrument (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens) used by virtually every major crypto project.

**All 5,000+ Republic investors received their tokens.** All 160+ private investors received their tokens. The distribution process worked for every single participant — **except Vivian Liu**, the one investor where Kenzi Wang inserted himself as the sole intermediary. If the fundraising were fraudulent, ALL investors would have been defrauded, not just the one connected to Kenzi Wang.

**Evidence needed:**
- Republic offering page (publicly available — confirms compliant offering)
- Token distribution records showing 5,160+ successful distributions

### ALLEGATIONS 55, 58 — Goopal's $100K Investment

> **Allegation 55:** "Goopal purchased 33,333,333 CERE tokens for $100,000 at 0.3 cents per token. Three tranches: 33% at ICO launch, 33% 6 months after IEO, 33% one year after ICO."
>
> **Allegation 58:** "July 2019, Goopal sent USDT equivalent of $100,000 to Cere Network digital wallet."

**Assessment:** ✅ PARTIALLY TRUE — investment was real, terms were real, payment was received; tokens were stolen by Kenzi, not withheld by Cere

**Rebuttal:**

**A. The Investment and Terms Are Not Disputed**

This is the CORE of the Goopal claim. We do not dispute:
- $100,000 was invested by Goopal Digital
- The price was 0.3 cents per token (standard early-stage pricing; public sale was 2–3.5 cents)
- 33,333,333 CERE tokens were allocated
- The three-tranche vesting schedule (33% at ICO, 33% at 6 months, 33% at 12 months)
- The USDT payment was received in July 2019

**B. The Tokens Were Distributed — To a Wallet Kenzi Controlled**

| Tranche | Date | Block | Amount | Destination |
|---------|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1st (33%) | March 25, 2022 | 4,361,724 | 13,333,334 CERE | Fake wallet (not Vivian's) |
| 2nd + 3rd (67%) | May 10, 2022 | 5,019,196 | 20,000,000 CERE | Same fake wallet |
| **Total** | | | **33,333,334 CERE** | **Intercepted by Kenzi Wang** |

The distribution system worked. The vesting schedule was honored. The tokens were sent. **Kenzi intercepted them** by planting a fake wallet address in the distribution mastersheet. Within 8 hours of distribution, the tokens were drained via a test-then-sweep pattern (2 CERE test → 3.3M → 30M → 1 CERE dust), cycled through an intermediary wallet, and returned to a company wallet. In January 2024, they were bridged to Ethereum and sold on KuCoin.

**C. Vivian Is Suing the Wrong Defendant**

Every step of the investment process was performed correctly by Cere:
1. ✅ Investment received ($100K USDT in July 2019)
2. ✅ Tokens allocated (33,333,333 CERE)
3. ✅ Vesting schedule applied (three tranches per agreement)
4. ✅ Tokens distributed per schedule
5. ❌ **Wallet address was fake** — planted by Kenzi Wang

The failure point was the wallet address, not the investment handling. Vivian's tokens were stolen by Kenzi, not withheld by Cere.

**D. Payment Destination (Allegation 58)**

The complaint states payment went to "Cere Network digital wallet." Given Kenzi's documented pattern of redirecting 75+ token purchasers to wallets he personally controlled, Fred should verify: **which wallet received Goopal's $100K USDT?** Was it a corporate treasury wallet or a wallet Kenzi controlled?

**Evidence needed:**
- Investment agreement for Goopal's $100K (with terms matching these allegations)
- Distribution records showing tokens sent to fake wallet on the correct vesting schedule
- Complete on-chain evidence chain (already documented in Sections 2 and 4)
- Wallet address that received the $100K USDT payment — was it corporate or Kenzi-controlled?

### ALLEGATIONS 59–62 — Tokenomics and Vesting Schedules

> **Allegations 59-60:** The full 10B CERE tokenomics breakdown:
> 1. Public investors (Republic etc): 11% = 1.1B
> 2. Enterprise Partners: 9% = 900M
> 3. Development Outreach: 8% = 800M
> 4. Network Development: 8.3% = 830M
> 5. Grants: 4.9% = 490M
> 6. Marketing: 5% = 500M
> 7. Leadership team (incl Jin): 5% = 500M
> 8. Advisors (incl Plaintiff): 6% = 600M
> 9. Foundation: 5% = 500M
> 10. Private sale investors: 20.8% = 2.08B
> 11. ERC20 Staking Rewards: 5% = 500M
>
> **Allegation 61:** "All but small portion of public sale tokens unlocked at ICO. Other categories locked 3+ months. Leadership team and advisors locked 6+ months."
>
> **Allegation 62:** "In April 2021, Jin and Broersma published Cere Network Tokenomics document in advance of investor sales."

**Assessment:** SUBSTANTIALLY TRUE — and all of this **supports our defense**, not the plaintiff's

**Rebuttal:**

**A. The Tokenomics Were Public, Transparent, and Standard**

These numbers were **publicly disclosed** before the token launch — on the Republic offering page, in the tokenomics document, and in investor materials. This is standard transparency for every legitimate token project and the opposite of concealment.

**B. The Allocations Are Conservative by Industry Standards**

| Category | Cere % | Industry Typical | Assessment |
|----------|--------|-----------------|------------|
| **Leadership team** | 5% | 10–20% | **CONSERVATIVE** — Solana ~12.8%, Avalanche 10%, Filecoin 15% |
| **Advisors** | 6% | 3–10% | Standard |
| **Private sale** | 20.8% | 15–30% | Standard |
| **Public sale** | 11% | 5–15% | Standard |
| **Ecosystem (Enterprise + Dev + Network + Grants + Marketing)** | 35.2% | 20–40% | Standard |
| **Foundation** | 5% | 5–15% | Standard |
| **Staking rewards** | 5% | 5–15% | Standard |

Fred's 5% leadership allocation is among the **lowest in the industry.** This is the opposite of a greedy pump-and-dump.

**C. Vesting Schedule (Allegation 61) Is Standard**

| Category | Lock-up | Industry Assessment |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| Public sale | Mostly unlocked at ICO | **Standard** — retail expects immediate liquidity |
| Other categories | 3+ months | **Standard** for ecosystem allocations |
| Leadership team | 6+ months | **Standard to conservative** |
| Advisors | 6+ months | **Standard** |

The vesting schedule is verifiable via on-chain token contracts. The critical question (addressed in Allegations 77–81) is whether vesting was actually honored — and if not, **who** violated it.

**D. Allegation 62 — ⚠️ MART IS NAMED**

"Jin and Broersma published" the tokenomics document. This was part of Mart's **operational role** — publishing tokenomics is:
- **Required by platforms** (Republic, DAO Maker, Polkastarter all require it)
- **Expected by investors** (you cannot raise money without publishing tokenomics)
- **The opposite of fraud** (disclosure ≠ concealment)
- Mart's consulting agreement stated he was **"NOT authorized to bind the Company"** — he prepared and released the document, he did not determine the allocation percentages

The complaint inadvertently proves transparency by citing a publicly published document.

**E. All Allocations Are Verifiable On-Chain**

Token supply, distributions, and vesting unlocks are permanently recorded on Cere Network blockchain (cere.statescan.io) and Ethereum (etherscan.io for ERC-20 CERE). These are not claims — they are on-chain facts.

**Evidence needed:**
- Tokenomics document (publicly available — April 2021)
- Republic offering page showing published tokenomics
- On-chain verification of vesting schedule adherence via smart contracts
- Mart's consulting agreement (showing "NOT authorized to bind the Company")

### ALLEGATIONS 63–65 — Jin's Representations to Liu & "All Were False"

> **Allegation 63:** "July 2019, Jin told Liu she would receive tokens for services and Goopal would receive tokens for investment. Jin boasted about partnerships, product progress, and prudent spending."
>
> **Allegation 64:** "Jin promised leadership team and insiders agreed to strict vesting schedule. Represented they could not sell until months after ICO."
>
> **Allegation 65:** "All of these representations made by Jin to Liu turned out to be false."

**Assessment:** ❌ FALSE / MISLEADING — most representations were actually TRUE, and the ones that "failed" were undermined by Kenzi, not falsified by Jin

**Rebuttal:**

**A. Allegation 63 — Token Promises and Business Claims**

We do not dispute that Jin discussed token allocations with Liu:
- **Advisory tokens:** Vivian had a Strategic Advisory Agreement for 20,000,000 CERE. Documented and legitimate.
- **Investment tokens:** Goopal's $100K entitled them to 33,333,333 CERE. Also documented and legitimate.
- Both allocations were entered into the distribution mastersheet and tokens were allocated and distributed (to a wallet Kenzi controlled — see Allegations 55/58).

As for "partnerships, product progress, and prudent spending":
- **Partnerships:** Fred must confirm what existed in July 2019. Standard early-stage advisor discussions.
- **Product progress:** DDC platform was being developed and was ultimately built and deployed — still operational in 2026.
- **Prudent spending:** Practus LLP investigation found no evidence of Fred misappropriating funds. The actual imprudent spending was by **Kenzi Wang** ($4.8M diverted + $3M "black swan" loss).

**B. Allegation 64 — Vesting Schedule Promises**

Vesting was publicly documented, published in tokenomics, and (likely) enforced by on-chain contracts. The key question: **were vesting schedules violated, and if so, BY WHOM?**

Three scenarios:
1. **Fred personally sold before vesting ended** → Fred must answer honestly
2. **Market maker deposits (Allegations 67–76) were different from insider sales** → Sending tokens to exchanges for MM is different from personally selling vested tokens
3. **Kenzi dumped through unauthorized channels** → Most likely for Vivian's tokens; Kenzi operated 75+ buyer relationships through personal wallets outside the official system

If Kenzi was the one violating vesting through unauthorized channels, Jin's promise was **genuine** — it was undermined by a criminal, not broken by the promiser.

**C. Allegation 65 — "All Were False" Is Conclusory and Wrong**

| Representation | Actually True? | Evidence |
|---------------|---------------|---------|
| "You'll receive tokens for services" | ✅ Tokens allocated (Kenzi stole them) | Distribution mastersheet |
| "Goopal will receive tokens for investment" | ✅ Tokens allocated (Kenzi stole them) | On-chain distribution records |
| "Strict vesting schedule" | ✅ Published and (likely) enforced | Tokenomics document, on-chain |
| "Product progress" | ✅ DDC platform built, operational in 2026 | Live at cere.network; Proofi built on DDC |
| "Prudent spending" | ✅ Per Practus investigation | Practus LLP report |

"All turned out to be false" fails the Rule 9(b) heightened pleading standard for fraud. It doesn't identify which specific representation was false, when the falsity was known, or how it was material. Bad outcomes (price crash, stolen tokens) ≠ false representations. The outcome was bad because **Kenzi stole the tokens and the market crashed** — not because Jin lied about the project.

**D. Critical Question for Fred: Were There Any Early Token Sales by the Team?**

If any insider sold tokens outside the vesting schedule, was it:
- Authorized by the board/treasury policy?
- Done by Fred personally, or by Kenzi operating independently?
- Through the market maker framework (different category) or personal sales?

Fred must answer this honestly. The vesting allegation is only dangerous if Fred personally violated it.

**Evidence needed:**
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Fred must confirm whether ANY insider sold tokens before vesting period ended
- Strategic Advisory Agreement + Goopal investment agreement (showing promises were documented)
- Practus LLP report (confirming no misappropriation)
- On-chain vesting contract verification
- Fred's answer: were there any authorized or unauthorized early token sales by the team?

### ⭐ ALLEGATION 66 — False Representations in 5 Categories

> **Claim:** Jin and others made false representations in five specific categories: (a) enterprise client claims, (b) token utility/adoption, (c) technical readiness, (d) transparency/roadmap, (e) DAO governance.

**Assessment:** ⚠️ MIXED — some claims were aspirational, some were premature, none constitute fraud per se

This is a compound allegation that requires addressing each sub-category separately. **Martijn is specifically named in 66a (Reddit AMA).**

#### 66a — Enterprise Client Claims ("Fortune 1000")

> *"April 2021 Medium blog: 'already working with Fortune 1000 customers.' July 2021 Reddit AMA: Jin and Broersma claimed 'running projects with Fortune 1000 companies' and 'already in the profitable stage.'"*

**Assessment:** ⚠️ NEEDS FRED INPUT — potentially the most damaging sub-allegation

**Rebuttal:** "Fortune 1000" is a specific, verifiable claim. If Cere had enterprise pilots, letters of intent, or even exploratory conversations with Fortune 1000 companies, those need to be documented. If the claims were aspirational or exaggerated marketing language common in crypto ("we're in talks with…" becoming "we're working with…"), that context matters but is still problematic.

**⚠️ MART IS NAMED — Reddit AMA context:** Martijn participated in a Reddit AMA alongside Fred Jin. The critical question is: **what did Mart actually say vs. what did Fred tell him to say?** If Mart was reading talking points prepared by Fred or the marketing team, his liability is different from independently fabricating claims. The AMA transcript needs to be reviewed to identify Mart's specific statements versus Fred's. In AMAs, it is standard for team members to relay company messaging — Mart was not in business development and had no independent knowledge of enterprise partnerships.

**Evidence needed:**
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Fred must list ALL enterprise relationships that existed in April–July 2021
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Retrieve the Reddit AMA transcript — identify exactly what Mart said vs. what Fred said
- ⚠️ Mart needs to explain: were the AMA talking points provided by Fred/marketing? Did Mart have independent knowledge of enterprise clients?
- Any LOIs, pilot agreements, NDAs, or correspondence with Fortune 1000 companies

#### 66b — Token Utility/Adoption Claims

> *"June 2020 AMA: 'immediate and sustainable growth post alpha mainnet launch.' Marketed as 'actual products and real-world clients.' Alpha network had no meaningful user base."*

**Assessment:** ⚠️ MISLEADING — aspirational claims common in all startups

**Rebuttal:** The DDC platform IS real and functional in 2026 — we literally built Proofi wallet on it (DDC Bucket #1229, DAC Merkle proofs verified). However, in June 2020, the product was early-stage. Claiming "immediate and sustainable growth" in 2020 was aspirational. Every startup pitches its future state — this is the nature of early-stage fundraising. The legal question is: did Fred know these claims were false *at the time they were made*, or did he genuinely believe in the trajectory? Building a working product (which DID happen) suggests genuine intent, not fraud.

**Evidence needed:**
- DDC development timeline — when did the platform become functional?
- User metrics at key dates (2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2026)
- Proofi wallet as evidence of real-world deployment

#### 66c — Technical Readiness Claims

> *"Sept 2021: mainnet 'launching quickly,' 'fully ready to supercharge adoption.' Reality: still in limited beta/alpha, unfinished security audits."*

**Assessment:** ⚠️ MISLEADING — delayed ≠ fraudulent

**Rebuttal:** The Cere mainnet **DID launch** — later than initially promised. Roadmap delays are not fraud; they are the norm in software development. Major blockchain projects that missed their timelines include Ethereum 2.0 (delayed by years), Cardano smart contracts (delayed repeatedly), Polkadot parachains (delayed 18+ months), and Filecoin (delayed 2+ years). None were considered fraud. An unfinished security audit at time of announcement does not mean the team intended to defraud — it means the product was in development. The mainnet was ultimately delivered.

**Evidence needed:**
- Mainnet launch dates (alpha, beta, full) with documentation
- Comparison table of other major crypto projects that missed timelines
- Security audit completion date

#### 66d — Transparency/Roadmap Delays

> *"Q1 2022 public mainnet beta, May 2022 full mainnet — both missed. Revised 'Vision 2.0' in late 2022/2023."*

**Assessment:** ❌ MISLEADING — roadmap revisions are industry standard

**Rebuttal:** Revising a technology roadmap is standard practice, not fraud. Apple, Google, Tesla, and every major tech company has revised product timelines. In crypto specifically, roadmap revisions are so common they are the expectation, not the exception. The fact that Cere published a "Vision 2.0" demonstrates continued development and transparency — they told the community about the revised timeline rather than going silent. This is the opposite of fraudulent behavior.

**Evidence needed:**
- "Vision 2.0" documentation showing continued development commitment
- Comparison with other crypto projects that revised roadmaps

#### 66e — DAO Governance Claims

> *"Late 2023 DAO launch: 'decentralized, inclusive, transparent governance.' Reality: governance centralized in founders/insiders throughout 2019-2023."*

**Assessment:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY TRUE — but doesn't constitute fraud

**Rebuttal:** The criticism that DAO governance was more centralized than marketed is valid for nearly every DAO in crypto. This is an industry-wide issue, not evidence of fraud specific to Cere. Uniswap, Compound, MakerDAO, and virtually every major DAO has faced criticism that governance is concentrated among insiders/large token holders. "Progressive decentralization" — where a project starts centralized and gradually decentralizes — is the accepted model. The gap between DAO marketing language and governance reality is an industry problem, not a Cere-specific fraud indicator.

**Evidence needed:**
- DAO governance documentation — when was it launched, what was the structure?
- Comparison with other DAOs' centralization criticism

---

### ⭐⭐ ALLEGATIONS 67–76 — Token Minting, Exchange Transfers & $41.78M Liquidation

> **Claim:** On Oct 31, 2021, 10B CERE tokens were minted on Ethereum and held in wallets under Jin's control. Tokens were transferred to a treasury wallet and then to HTX and KuCoin exchanges, where they were liquidated for $41.78M. Specific tx hashes provided.

**Assessment:** 🔴 MOST DANGEROUS ALLEGATIONS — specific on-chain data that must be addressed precisely

**⚠️ MART IS NAMED IN ALLEGATION 69** as having "caused" token transfers to exchanges.

These allegations are the most technically specific in the complaint and contain verifiable on-chain transaction hashes. They cannot be dismissed — they must be explained.

#### Allegation 67 — Token Minting (10B CERE)

> *"Oct 31, 2021: 10B CERE tokens minted on Ethereum, held in wallets under Jin's control."*

**Assessment:** ✅ TRUE (but misleading framing) — minting tokens is the first step of ANY token launch

**Rebuttal:** Minting the total token supply is **the necessary first step of every token launch.** You cannot distribute tokens without first creating them. Bitcoin mined its genesis block. Ethereum minted its presale tokens. Solana minted its initial supply. Every ERC-20 token in existence was "minted" into a wallet "under someone's control." Framing this as nefarious is like accusing a bank of fraud for printing currency before distributing it. The tokens were minted to a treasury wallet as part of the planned token generation event (TGE) that was publicly announced and documented in the tokenomics.

#### Allegation 68 — Treasury Transfer

> *"Tokens transferred to treasury wallet 0x218F4947c58A8F2BC8F2c0cd59494992c6d640f."*

**Assessment:** ✅ TRUE — standard treasury management

**Rebuttal:** Moving minted tokens to a treasury wallet is standard treasury management. This is the operational step between minting and distribution/listing. The treasury wallet is a holding address — not evidence of misappropriation.

#### Allegation 69 — Exchange Transfers (MART NAMED)

> *"Nov 8, 2021 ICO: Jin, Bao, Xin Jin, BROERSMA, and Schwarzer caused transfers to HTX and KuCoin."*

**Assessment:** ⚠️ MISLEADING — exchange transfers are REQUIRED for token listings

**Rebuttal:** You **cannot list a token on an exchange without sending tokens to that exchange.** This is physically how exchange listings work. Every token ever listed on any exchange — from Bitcoin to Ethereum to Solana — required someone to transfer tokens to the exchange's hot wallet. The complaint frames a mandatory technical step as evidence of fraud. HTX and KuCoin were legitimate exchange listings that were publicly announced, celebrated by the community, and increased CERE's accessibility to retail investors.

**Mart's specific role (CRITICAL):** The complaint names Mart as having "caused" these transfers. Mart's actual involvement was **administrative processing** — he may have processed transaction requests or coordinated logistics, but:
- He was **NOT a Fireblocks multi-sig signer** — he could not authorize transfers
- Per his consulting agreement: Mart was explicitly **"NOT authorized to bind the Company"**
- He did not decide to list on HTX/KuCoin — those were business decisions made by Fred Jin
- He did not control the treasury wallet or have signing authority
- "Causing" a transfer by handling paperwork is fundamentally different from deciding to make the transfer

**Evidence needed:**
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Mart's consulting agreement showing "NOT authorized to bind the Company"
- Fireblocks access logs confirming Mart was not a signer
- Documentation showing who made the decision to list on HTX and KuCoin (Fred/board)

#### Allegations 70–72 — Specific Transfer Amounts and Tx Hashes

> *"300M tokens to HTX ($44.53M = 120M at $26.72M + 180M at $17.81M). 250M tokens to KuCoin ($37.11M = 232M at $34.44M + 18M at $2.67M). Specific etherscan TX hashes provided for all 4 transfers."*

**Assessment:** ⚠️ AMOUNTS LIKELY TRUE — but the framing as "liquidation" is misleading

**Rebuttal:** Sending 550M tokens (300M + 250M) to two major exchanges is consistent with legitimate token listing activities. The tokens sent to exchanges serve multiple purposes:
1. **Exchange liquidity pools** — exchanges require token deposits to enable trading pairs
2. **Market maker allocations** — designated market makers need inventory to provide bid/ask liquidity
3. **Reward/incentive programs** — exchange-based staking, trading competitions, etc.
4. **Ongoing distribution** — vested token releases to investors via exchange

The complaint assumes all 550M tokens were immediately "dumped" for personal gain. This is not necessarily what happened. **Fred must explain:** What portion was for liquidity provision? What portion was for market making? Were tokens sold by market makers per agreement terms? Were any tokens sold by insiders personally?

The tx hashes are verifiable on Etherscan. We cannot dispute the transfers occurred. We must explain their purpose.

**Evidence needed:**
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Fred must explain the purpose of each transfer (liquidity, MM, distribution, etc.)
- Exchange listing agreements with HTX and KuCoin showing required token deposits
- Market maker agreements showing allocated amounts
- Records of what happened to the tokens AFTER they reached the exchanges

#### Allegation 73 — Tokens to Personal Accounts

> *"Tokens transferred to Schwarzer's and Xin Jin's HTX accounts, and Jin's KuCoin accounts."*

**Assessment:** 🔴 NEEDS IMMEDIATE FRED INPUT — this is critical

**Rebuttal:** If exchange accounts were in the names of Maren Schwarzer, Xin Jin, and Fred Jin personally (rather than corporate accounts), Fred must explain why. Possible legitimate explanations include: (a) exchange KYC requirements that required a personal name as account signatory for the corporate account, (b) personal accounts used temporarily while corporate accounts were being set up, (c) the accounts were effectively corporate accounts registered under individual names (common in crypto, especially in 2021 when many exchanges didn't offer proper corporate accounts). However, if these were truly personal accounts used to receive corporate tokens, that is problematic and Fred must provide a clear explanation.

**Evidence needed:**
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Were the HTX and KuCoin accounts corporate or personal? Who controlled them?
- Exchange account registration documents
- If personal: why? What was the business justification?

#### Allegations 74–75 — $41.78M Conversion to USDT

> *"$41.78M converted to USDT via HTX and KuCoin market maker accounts."*

**Assessment:** ⚠️ NEEDS FRED INPUT — "market maker accounts" framing is ambiguous

**Rebuttal:** If these were market maker accounts (i.e., accounts operated by a designated market maker like Gotbit under a market-making agreement), then the conversion to USDT is part of normal market-making operations. Market makers buy and sell tokens, providing liquidity and managing order books. The $41.78M figure would represent total trading volume through MM accounts, not personal profit. However, the complaint implies these were personal accounts disguised as "market maker" accounts. Fred must clarify the account structure and who controlled these accounts.

**Evidence needed:**
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Who operated the "market maker accounts"? Gotbit? Cere directly? Individuals?
- Market-making agreement showing terms, fees, and operational structure
- Account statements showing whether proceeds went to corporate treasury or personal wallets

#### Allegation 76 — "$26.39M to Laundering Wallets"

> *"$26.39M moved to 3 'laundering wallets' controlled by Jin."*

**Assessment:** 🔴 NEEDS IMMEDIATE FRED INPUT — specific wallet addresses will be verifiable

**Rebuttal:** The term "laundering wallets" is the complaint's characterization, not a fact. The critical question is: what ARE these three wallets? If they are corporate operational wallets used for treasury management, payroll, or vendor payments, calling them "laundering wallets" is defamatory. If they are personal wallets where Fred moved funds without corporate authorization, that is a serious problem. Fred must identify these wallets and explain the fund flow.

**Evidence needed:**
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Fred must identify the 3 wallets and explain their purpose
- Transaction records showing where the $26.39M ultimately went (payroll? vendors? treasury? personal?)
- Corporate authorization for the transfers (board resolution, treasury policy, etc.)

---

### ALLEGATIONS 77–81 — Lock-Up Violations & Price Crash

> **Claim:** Defendants liquidated tokens without authorization or notice, contrary to lock-up promises. Tokens were sold at ATH ($0.47 on Nov 8, 2021). Price crashed from $0.45 to $0.06 by Dec 31, 2021, and is now at $0.0012 (99.7% decline). $41.78M was diverted through offshore shells and personal exchange accounts.

**Assessment:** ⚠️ MISLEADING — attributes market-wide crash entirely to insider selling

#### Allegation 77 — Lock-Up Violations

**Rebuttal:** If tokens sent to exchanges were for market making (not personal selling), lock-up commitments may not have been violated — market maker inventory is a different category from insider token holdings. However, if insiders sold personal allocations before vesting, that is a genuine issue. Fred must confirm whether any insider sold tokens before their vesting period ended.

#### Allegation 78 — Selling at ATH

**Rebuttal:** Selling at or near all-time high is what market makers do — they sell into demand. That is literally the job of a market maker (sell when price is high, buy when price is low, maintaining the spread). If Gotbit or another MM was selling per their agreement, selling at $0.47 was them doing their job. The question is whether *insiders personally* sold at ATH outside the MM framework.

#### Allegations 79–80 — Price Crash (99.7%)

**Rebuttal:** The entire cryptocurrency market crashed catastrophically during this period:

| Asset | Peak | Trough | Decline |
|-------|------|--------|---------|
| **Bitcoin** | $69,000 (Nov 2021) | $15,500 (Nov 2022) | −77% |
| **Ethereum** | $4,800 (Nov 2021) | $880 (Jun 2022) | −82% |
| **Polkadot** | $55 (Nov 2021) | $4.23 (Nov 2022) | −92% |
| **Solana** | $260 (Nov 2021) | $8.00 (Dec 2022) | −97% |
| **Avalanche** | $146 (Nov 2021) | $10 (Nov 2022) | −93% |
| **LUNA/Terra** | $119 (Apr 2022) | $0.00 (May 2022) | −100% |
| **FTT (FTX)** | $84 (Sep 2021) | $0.00 (Nov 2022) | −100% |

Thousands of legitimate projects experienced 95–99%+ declines. CERE's price trajectory is consistent with the broader market, not evidence of a unique pump-and-dump scheme. The complaint cherry-picks CERE's price while ignoring that the entire asset class collapsed.

#### Allegation 81 — $41.78M Through Offshore Shells

**Rebuttal:** See rebuttal to Allegations 73–76 above. The characterization of Interdata (BVI) as an "offshore shell" has been addressed in Section 3 and Allegations 17–19. "Offshore" BVI entity for token issuance is industry standard. Whether funds flowed through personal accounts vs. corporate accounts is the real issue, and Fred must address this.

**Evidence needed:**
- ⚠️ Fred must confirm: did ANY insider sell personal token allocations before vesting?
- Market maker agreement showing authorized selling parameters
- Market crash comparison data (provided above)

---

### ⭐⭐⭐ ALLEGATIONS 82–89 — Money Flow & Gotbit (MART NAMED TWICE)

> **Claim:** $41.78M was routed through Schwarzer/Xin Jin's exchange accounts → Interdata (BVI) → Opendata Network Foundation (Panama) → Cerebellum (DE) → BNW (Germany, Schwarzer). Gotbit used bots for wash trading. The arrangement was "negotiated by BROERSMA and Jin." BROERSMA made promotional statements while Gotbit was selling.

**Assessment:** 🔴 EXTREMELY DANGEROUS — Mart is named as (1) Gotbit negotiator and (2) promoter during dump

**⚠️ MART IS NAMED TWICE IN THESE ALLEGATIONS:**
1. **Allegation 84–85:** "Arrangement negotiated by BROERSMA and Jin"
2. **Allegation 87:** "BROERSMA made promotional statements on Reddit, Telegram, press about mainnet, Fortune 500 clients, insider lockups" while Gotbit was selling

#### Allegations 82–83 — Money Flow Chain

> *"$41.78M routed: Schwarzer/Xin Jin exchange accounts → Interdata (BVI) → Opendata Network Foundation (Panama) → Cerebellum (DE) → BNW Network GmbH (Germany, Schwarzer)"*

**Assessment:** 🔴 NEEDS IMMEDIATE FRED INPUT — this is the most detailed financial allegation

**Rebuttal:** This is the most specific money flow allegation in the complaint. Each hop in the chain must be explained with a legitimate business purpose:

| Hop | Entity | Claimed Direction | Possible Legitimate Purpose |
|-----|--------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| 1 | Exchange accounts (personal names) | Receive token sale proceeds | Exchange KYC required personal names (2021 era) |
| 2 | → Interdata (BVI) | Consolidated | BVI entity = token issuer, natural recipient of token sale proceeds |
| 3 | → Opendata Foundation (Panama) | Pass-through | ⚠️ Fred must explain this entity's role — not previously documented |
| 4 | → Cerebellum (DE) | Operating entity | US operating company receiving funds for operations |
| 5 | → BNW Network GmbH | EU operations | German entity for EU operational expenses |

**⚠️ "Opendata Network Foundation (Panama)" is a NEW entity** not previously mentioned in our defense documents. Fred must immediately explain: What is this entity? When was it formed? What is its purpose? Why did funds flow through it?

**Evidence needed:**
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Fred must explain EVERY hop in this chain with documentation
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** What is "Opendata Network Foundation (Panama)"? When formed? Purpose?
- Bank statements or transfer records showing the business purpose of each transfer
- Any board resolutions or treasury policies authorizing this fund flow structure

#### Allegations 84–85 — Gotbit Arrangement "Negotiated by BROERSMA and Jin"

> *"Alex Andryunin/Gotbit used bots to slice bulk sales, cross-exchange transfers, recycle volume. Arrangement negotiated by BROERSMA and Jin."*

**Assessment:** 🔴 CRITICAL FOR MART'S DEFENSE

**Rebuttal — MART'S ROLE:**

The allegation that Mart "negotiated" the Gotbit arrangement must be addressed head-on. Three possible scenarios:

**Scenario A (most likely):** Mart handled administrative/logistical coordination for a market-making agreement that Fred decided on. In this scenario, "negotiated" is the complaint's inflation of "processed paperwork" or "coordinated logistics." Mart may have been the point of contact for scheduling calls, forwarding contracts, or coordinating technical details (wallet addresses, token amounts) — administrative functions, not deal-making.

**Scenario B:** Mart was involved in discussions about market making but did not make the decision to hire Gotbit. Fred decided; Mart facilitated. Even if Mart participated in calls with Gotbit, he was executing Fred's strategy, not his own.

**Scenario C (problematic):** Mart independently sourced and negotiated the Gotbit relationship. If true, this needs to be addressed with full context — market making is legal, and Mart would have been acting in his operational capacity, not independently defrauding anyone.

**⚠️ MART MUST ANSWER:** What was your actual involvement with Gotbit? Did you have calls/emails with them? Were you executing instructions from Fred? Do you have emails/Slack messages showing the chain of instruction?

**General rebuttal on Gotbit:** Market making is standard in crypto. The description of Gotbit's activities — "slice bulk sales, cross-exchange transfers, recycle volume" — describes standard market-making techniques used by every major market maker (Wintermute, GSR, Amber Group, etc.). Breaking large orders into smaller ones is called "order slicing" and prevents market impact. Cross-exchange transfers maintain price parity. These are legitimate practices. The complaint frames them as nefarious because Gotbit was later convicted — but the conviction was for separate conduct, not for standard market-making services provided to clients.

**Evidence needed:**
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL FOR MART:** All emails/Slack messages between Mart and Gotbit
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL FOR MART:** All emails/Slack messages from Fred instructing Mart regarding Gotbit
- The Gotbit market-making agreement (contract, scope, terms)
- Evidence showing who made the decision to hire Gotbit (Fred, board, or Mart?)

#### Allegations 86 — Gotbit Fees and Deposit Accounts

> *"Gotbit received fees. Proceeds deposited to Schwarzer, Xin Jin, and Interdata accounts."*

**Assessment:** ⚠️ NEEDS FRED INPUT

**Rebuttal:** Market makers receive fees — that is standard. The question is where the NET proceeds (after MM fees) were deposited. If deposited to Interdata (the BVI token issuer), that is the natural corporate recipient. If deposited to Schwarzer's and Xin Jin's personal accounts, Fred must explain why (see Allegation 73 rebuttal).

#### Allegation 87 — MART's Promotional Statements During Dumping

> *"While Gotbit was selling, BROERSMA and Bao made promotional statements on Reddit, Telegram, press about mainnet, Fortune 500 clients, insider lockups."*

**Assessment:** 🔴 CRITICAL FOR MART'S DEFENSE — creates "pump while dumping" narrative

**Rebuttal:** This allegation attempts to frame Mart as a knowing participant in a pump-and-dump: Gotbit sells (dump) while Mart promotes (pump). The defense requires establishing:

1. **What did Mart actually say?** The complaint doesn't quote specific statements. We need to identify exactly what Mart posted on Reddit and Telegram. Were they factual community updates? Answers to user questions? Standard project updates?

2. **Did Mart know Gotbit was selling at the time?** If Mart was doing routine community management (answering questions, posting updates) and was unaware of simultaneous market-making sales, he cannot have participated in a coordinated scheme. Community managers post updates — that is their job.

3. **Were the statements false?** If Mart posted about mainnet progress that was real, or about partnerships that existed, the statements weren't "false promotional claims" — they were legitimate community updates that happened to coincide with market-making activity he had no visibility into.

4. **Reddit/Telegram community management ≠ securities fraud.** Answering community questions and posting project updates is standard crypto project communication. The complaint reframes routine community management as part of a fraud scheme by placing it adjacent to MM selling.

**⚠️ MART MUST ANSWER:**
- What did you post on Reddit and Telegram during Nov 2021 – early 2022?
- Were you doing community management (answering questions, posting updates)?
- Did you know Gotbit was actively selling at the time you posted?
- Were your posts based on information Fred/marketing gave you?

**Evidence needed:**
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Archive of Mart's Reddit and Telegram posts from this period
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Internal communications showing whether Mart knew about Gotbit's selling schedule
- Mart's community management responsibilities — job description, instructions from Fred

#### Allegation 88 — Purpose of False Statements Was to Enable Dump

> *"Purpose of these false statements was to prop up demand to enable the dump."*

**Assessment:** ❌ FALSE — this is the complaint's interpretation, not a fact

**Rebuttal:** This is a conclusory allegation, not a factual one. The complaint assumes intent ("purpose was to prop up demand") without evidence of coordination between community posts and market-making activity. For this allegation to succeed, the plaintiffs would need to prove: (a) the statements were knowingly false, (b) they were coordinated with Gotbit's selling schedule, and (c) Mart specifically intended to inflate the price for dumping. None of these elements are established — they are assumed. Routine community management and market making happening simultaneously does not prove coordination.

### ⭐⭐⭐ ALLEGATIONS 90–99 — RegD Wallet Drainage ($16.6M) — FRED'S BIGGEST EXPOSURE

> **Claim:** A RegD wallet (0xbc8d28cd...) containing $28M from 5,000+ retail investors was drained of $16.6M, which was transferred to "Jin Wallet A" (0x4131...) and "Jin Wallet B" (0x14d2...). Specific transactions provided with dates and amounts. Funds were then "gambled" in DeFi protocols, resulting in massive losses.

**Assessment:** 🔴🔴🔴 MOST DANGEROUS ALLEGATIONS IN THE ENTIRE COMPLAINT — specific on-chain data with wallet addresses, dates, and amounts

**These allegations are directed primarily at Fred, not Mart.** However, they threaten the entire defense because if Fred cannot explain these transactions, the complaint's overall fraud narrative gains credibility.

#### Allegation 91 — RegD Wallet ($28M from Retail Investors)

> *"RegD Wallet 0xbc8d28cd... contained $28M from 5,000+ retail investors."*

**Assessment:** ⚠️ NEEDS VERIFICATION — was this a RegD offering wallet or a general treasury?

**Rebuttal:** The characterization of this wallet as a "RegD wallet" may be misleading. Need to confirm: was this the Republic.com offering wallet? A general treasury wallet? A operational wallet? The label matters — if it was a general corporate treasury that received funds from multiple sources (not just retail investors), then characterizing it as "retail investor money" is misleading.

#### Allegation 92 — $16.6M Transferred to "Jin Wallets"

> *"$16.6M diverted to Jin Wallet A (0x4131...) and Jin Wallet B (0x14d2...)."*

**Assessment:** 🔴 NEEDS IMMEDIATE FRED INPUT — these are specific wallet addresses

**Rebuttal:** The critical question: **Were these corporate operational wallets or Fred's personal wallets?** If corporate: they would have been used for payroll, vendor payments, infrastructure costs, legal fees, etc. — $16.6M over multiple years for a 30+ person international company is not unusual. If personal: Fred is in serious trouble. The wallet addresses are on-chain and verifiable — there is no disputing whether the transfers occurred. The only defense is explaining their purpose.

**Evidence needed:**
- ⚠️ **MOST CRITICAL QUESTION IN THIS DOCUMENT:** Are 0x4131... and 0x14d2... corporate wallets or personal wallets? Who controls them?
- If corporate: complete breakdown of what the $16.6M was spent on
- If mixed: which portion was corporate expenses and which was personal?

#### Allegation 94 — Specific Transaction Amounts and Dates

> *"$4M (Oct 3, 2021), $3.5M (Oct 4, 2021), $1M (Oct 11, 2021), $1.4M (Oct 16, 2021)."*

**Assessment:** 🔴 ON-CHAIN AND VERIFIABLE — cannot be disputed, must be explained

**Rebuttal:** These are specific, dated, on-chain transactions that the other side has already verified. Each individual transfer must be explained:

| Date | Amount | Fred Must Explain: |
|------|--------|--------------------|
| Oct 3, 2021 | $4.0M | What was this for? Payroll? Exchange deposit? Vendor? |
| Oct 4, 2021 | $3.5M | What was this for? (Back-to-back $7.5M is notable) |
| Oct 11, 2021 | $1.0M | What was this for? |
| Oct 16, 2021 | $1.4M | What was this for? |

**All four transfers occurred in October 2021 — one month before the Nov 8, 2021 ICO.** This timing will be scrutinized. Fred must explain whether these were pre-ICO operational expenses, exchange deposits for listing, or something else.

**Evidence needed:**
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Fred must explain each of these four specific transactions with documentation
- Bank/wallet records showing the destination and purpose of each transfer
- Any board approvals or treasury policies governing these transfers

#### Allegations 95–97 — DeFi "Gambling" ($9.78M in Losses)

> *"Jin gambled stolen funds: $6.51M lost in Mochi Protocol, $345K in Neutrino USDN, $3.27M in CVX/ETH liquidity pools, $780K in Maple Finance. Total losses: $9.78M."*

**Assessment:** 🔴 THIS IS THE HARDEST ALLEGATION TO REBUT IN THE ENTIRE COMPLAINT

**Rebuttal depends entirely on Fred's answers:**

| Protocol | Loss | Key Question |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Mochi Protocol** | $6.51M | Was this authorized treasury management? Mochi was a legitimate DeFi protocol that later had issues — many institutional treasuries used it |
| **Neutrino USDN** | $345K | USDN was a stablecoin that depegged. Many treasuries held USDN. Was this approved? |
| **CVX/ETH pools** | $3.27M | Convex/Curve liquidity provision is standard yield strategy used by DAOs and corporate treasuries. Was this authorized? |
| **Maple Finance** | $780K | Maple is an institutional lending protocol. Used by many treasuries. Was this authorized? |

**The defense fork:**

**If authorized by the board/treasury policy:** These were legitimate treasury management decisions that lost money due to market conditions. Many corporate crypto treasuries deployed funds into DeFi in 2021 — Mochi, Neutrino, Curve/Convex, and Maple were all considered reputable at the time. Losing money in DeFi is not fraud — it is investment risk. The question is whether the treasury policy authorized DeFi deployment and whether the board was informed.

**If NOT authorized:** Fred unilaterally deployed corporate funds into risky DeFi protocols without board approval, resulting in $9.78M in losses. This is the complaint's strongest argument for breach of fiduciary duty and potentially fraud. Fred's defense would need to show that he had discretionary authority over treasury management, which is common for crypto startup CEOs.

**If these were personal wallets:** If Fred moved funds from corporate wallets to personal wallets and then deployed them into DeFi personally, that is misappropriation regardless of the outcome. This scenario is indefensible.

**Evidence needed:**
- ⚠️ **MOST CRITICAL:** Were the DeFi positions entered from corporate wallets or personal wallets?
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Was there a treasury management policy? Did it authorize DeFi deployment?
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Was the board informed of these DeFi positions?
- Transaction records showing the fund flow from the wallets to DeFi protocols
- If authorized: board resolution or treasury policy document
- Comparison: other crypto treasuries that deployed into the same protocols in 2021

#### Allegation 98 — Only $585K Remains

> *"Only $585K remains in Jin wallets as of Aug 2025."*

**Assessment:** 🔴 DAMAGING — implies funds were dissipated

**Rebuttal:** If these were operational wallets, $585K remaining after 4 years of operations (2021–2025) is explainable — money was spent on operations. If personal wallets, the depletion is harder to explain. Fred must provide a complete accounting of outflows from these wallets.

#### Allegation 99 — False Claims About Hardware Wallet

> *"Jin told investors $22M was in hardware wallet + $2M in multi-sig. False — already siphoned."*

**Assessment:** 🔴 NEEDS IMMEDIATE FRED INPUT — if Jin made this claim while the money was already deployed in DeFi, that is a material misrepresentation

**Rebuttal:** If Fred told investors $22M was in a hardware wallet at a time when $16.6M had already been transferred out and $9.78M was lost in DeFi, that is a false statement and the most difficult point to defend. Fred must clarify: (a) When exactly did he make this claim? (b) What was actually in the hardware wallet at that time? (c) Was the $22M figure accurate at any point? (d) Did the DeFi deployments happen before or after the $22M claim?

**Evidence needed:**
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** When did Fred claim $22M was in hardware wallet? To whom?
- What was the actual hardware wallet balance at that time?
- Timeline: hardware wallet claim vs. DeFi deployments vs. DeFi losses

### ALLEGATIONS 100–105 — Token Non-Delivery to Vivian & Intimidation

#### Allegations 100–103 — "Tokens Withheld from Liu"

> *"Liu repeatedly demanded tokens. Jin offered excuses (technical issues, regulatory). Tokens withheld because Jin prioritized his own sales."*

**Assessment:** ❌ FALSE NARRATIVE — tokens were not "withheld," they were stolen by Kenzi

**Rebuttal:** This narrative is completely wrong. The tokens were not "withheld" — they were **distributed to a wallet that Kenzi Wang controlled**, not Vivian. The full evidence chain:

1. **Dec 23, 2021:** Kenzi said "I'll handle Vivian" in Slack — became sole intermediary
2. **Late 2021:** Kenzi provided a fake wallet address that Vivian never controlled
3. **Mar–May 2022:** 33,333,334 CERE distributed to the fake wallet
4. **Within 8 hours:** Tokens drained via test-then-sweep pattern → intermediary → back to company wallet
5. **Jan 6–7, 2024:** Tokens bridged to Ethereum and sold on KuCoin
6. **Smoking gun:** Bridge wallet funded by Kenzi's identified wallet (0x0d07...); same wallet holds AU21 portfolio tokens (SKYRIM #1 holder, RAZE #1 holder)

The claim that "Jin offered excuses" inverts the actual situation. Fred/Cere believed the tokens had been successfully distributed (because the mastersheet showed them as sent). It was only when Vivian claimed non-receipt that the investigation uncovered the fake wallet. The "excuses" were likely genuine confusion, not cover-up.

**If "Liu repeatedly demanded tokens"** — who did she demand them from? Through what channel? If through Kenzi (her sole contact), then Kenzi was fielding her demands while knowing he'd stolen the tokens. If directly to Cere, we need those communications.

**Evidence needed:**
- All communications between Vivian/Kevin and Cere (including those through Kenzi)
- Mart's Nov 14, 2023 email (proactively reaching out to Vivian)
- Evidence of Kenzi as sole intermediary (Slack messages)

#### ⭐ Allegation 104 — MART "Threatened Lawsuits for Breach of Confidentiality"

> *"BROERSMA told Liu and former employees that criticism or claims of financial improprieties would be met with lawsuits for breach of confidentiality."*

**Assessment:** 🔴 CRITICAL FOR MART — must be addressed directly

**Rebuttal — scenario analysis:**

**If Mart never said this:** The allegation is fabricated, consistent with the pattern of false claims against Mart throughout the complaint. Demand the plaintiff identify: when, to whom, in what medium (email, call, message)?

**If Mart referenced NDA obligations:** Reminding someone of their contractual NDA obligations is **not** intimidation — it is standard business practice. Every startup has NDAs. When departing employees or disgruntled investors threaten to make public claims, companies routinely remind them of confidentiality obligations. This is legal, normal, and expected. The complaint reframes standard NDA enforcement as "intimidation."

**If Mart sent a more aggressive communication:** Even if Mart sent a firm communication about confidentiality, the context matters. Was it in response to Kenzi's defamation campaign? Was it to protect legitimate trade secrets? Was it sent on advice of counsel? A company defending itself against false public allegations by reminding parties of their NDAs is not "threatening and intimidating" — it is self-defense.

**⚠️ MART MUST ANSWER HONESTLY:**
- Did you ever communicate with Vivian/Kevin about confidentiality or NDAs?
- Did you ever communicate with former employees about confidentiality?
- If yes: what did you say, when, to whom, and in what context?
- Were you acting on Fred's or counsel's instructions?
- Do you have copies of these communications?

**Evidence needed:**
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Any emails/messages from Mart referencing confidentiality, NDAs, or potential legal action
- Context: what prompted these communications? (Kenzi's defamation campaign? Public false statements?)
- Whether Mart was acting on instructions from Fred or legal counsel

#### Allegation 105 — Discovery of Secret Token Sales

> *"2024–2025: Plaintiffs discovered secret token sales and fund misappropriation."*

**Assessment:** ⚠️ MISLEADING

**Rebuttal:** The "discovery" timing coincides with Kenzi Wang's defamation campaign and the filing of his Delaware Chancery complaint. The plaintiffs didn't independently discover anything — they were fed a narrative by Kenzi, who needed to create a smokescreen for his own theft. The "secret token sales" are the exchange listings and market-making activities addressed in Allegations 67–76, which were not secret — they were publicly visible on-chain from day one. The "fund misappropriation" is the RegD wallet allegations (90–99), which were sourced from Kenzi's narrative.

## 8. MARTIJN BROERSMA — COMPLETE EXPOSURE MAP

**Every allegation where Mart is specifically named, and the defense posture for each.**

| # | Allegation | What's Claimed | Defense Status | Risk Level |
|---|-----------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| **13** | CMO title, false representations, threats, $12M signoff | Never CMO, never made claims, proactively helped Vivian, not a Fireblocks signer | ✅ Strong defense | 🟡 Medium |
| **62** | Published tokenomics with Jin | Standard transparency, required by Republic | ✅ Strong defense | 🟢 Low |
| **66a** | Reddit AMA: Fortune 1000 claims, "profitable stage" | ⚠️ Need AMA transcript — was Mart reading Fred's talking points? | ⚠️ Incomplete | 🔴 High |
| **69** | "Caused" token transfers to HTX/KuCoin | Administrative role, not a signer, "NOT authorized to bind the Company" | ✅ Strong defense | 🟡 Medium |
| **84–85** | "Negotiated" Gotbit arrangement | ⚠️ Need Mart's actual involvement — admin coordination vs. deal negotiation | ⚠️ Incomplete | 🔴 High |
| **87** | Promotional statements during Gotbit selling | ⚠️ Need post archive — community management vs. coordinated pump | ⚠️ Incomplete | 🔴 High |
| **104** | Threatened lawsuits for breach of confidentiality | ⚠️ Need Mart's account — NDA reminder vs. intimidation | ⚠️ Incomplete | 🔴 High |

### Mart's Defense Summary

**Strong points:**
- Never held CMO title — operational/admin role only
- $150K salary inconsistent with fraud profiteer
- NOT a Fireblocks multi-sig signer — could not authorize transfers
- Consulting agreement explicitly states "NOT authorized to bind the Company"
- Proactively contacted Vivian to help (Nov 14, 2023) — opposite of conspirator behavior
- Practus LLP found Mart credible in investigation interview
- $41.78M figure copy-pasted identically for every defendant — not individual

**Vulnerable points (MUST BE ADDRESSED):**
- ⚠️ Reddit AMA (Allegation 66a): What exactly did Mart say about Fortune 1000/profitability?
- ⚠️ Gotbit (Allegations 84–85): What was Mart's actual role in the Gotbit relationship?
- ⚠️ Promotional posts (Allegation 87): What did Mart post, and did he know about MM selling?
- ⚠️ Confidentiality threats (Allegation 104): Did Mart send communications about NDAs/lawsuits?

**⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED: Mart must provide complete, honest answers to these four questions BEFORE the next legal filing. Incomplete answers are more dangerous than bad answers — counsel needs to know the full picture to build the defense.**

## 9. FRED JIN — CRITICAL EXPOSURE MAP

**Allegations 90–99 represent Fred's most serious exposure. Unlike other allegations, these are specific on-chain transactions that cannot be hand-waved.**

| # | Allegation | Risk Level | Can We Rebut Without Fred? |
|---|-----------|------------|---------------------------|
| **91–92** | $16.6M from RegD wallet to "Jin Wallets" | 🔴🔴🔴 CRITICAL | ❌ NO — need wallet ownership clarification |
| **94** | 4 specific transfers ($4M, $3.5M, $1M, $1.4M) | 🔴🔴🔴 CRITICAL | ❌ NO — need purpose of each transfer |
| **95–97** | $9.78M DeFi losses (Mochi, USDN, CVX, Maple) | 🔴🔴🔴 CRITICAL | ❌ NO — need authorization status |
| **98** | Only $585K remaining | 🔴🔴 HIGH | ❌ NO — need complete outflow accounting |
| **99** | "$22M in hardware wallet" claim was false | 🔴🔴🔴 CRITICAL | ❌ NO — need timeline and actual balances |
| **73** | Tokens sent to personal exchange accounts | 🔴🔴 HIGH | ❌ NO — need account ownership clarification |
| **76** | "$26.39M to laundering wallets" | 🔴🔴 HIGH | ❌ NO — need wallet identification |
| **82** | Money flow chain through 5 entities | 🔴🔴 HIGH | ❌ NO — need each hop explained |

**Bottom line: The defense of Allegations 90–99 is ENTIRELY dependent on Fred's answers. These are on-chain, verifiable, specific transactions. If Fred cannot provide legitimate explanations with documentation, these allegations will stick — and they will damage the credibility of the entire defense, including Mart's.**

## 10. CRITICAL QUESTIONS FOR FRED

*These questions must be answered by Fred Jin to complete our defense. Organized by urgency and topic. 46 total questions.*

### 🔴🔴🔴 EMERGENCY PRIORITY — Answer IMMEDIATELY (Allegations 90–99)

*These are the most dangerous allegations in the complaint. They contain specific wallet addresses, transaction amounts, dates, and DeFi protocol names — all verifiable on-chain. We CANNOT build a defense without Fred's answers. If these go unanswered, they will destroy the credibility of the entire defense, including Mart's.*

#### RegD Wallet & "Jin Wallets" (Allegations 91–92, 94)
1. **What is wallet 0xbc8d28cd...?** Is this the Republic.com offering wallet? A general treasury wallet? Who controlled it?
2. **Were "Jin Wallet A" (0x4131...) and "Jin Wallet B" (0x14d2...) CORPORATE operational wallets or PERSONAL wallets?** This is the single most important question in the entire case. If corporate: provide evidence (multi-sig setup, corporate authorization, board knowledge). If personal: this is the strongest part of the complaint and you must explain immediately.
3. **The four specific October 2021 transfers — explain each one:**
   - Oct 3, 2021: $4.0M — what was this for?
   - Oct 4, 2021: $3.5M — what was this for? (Back-to-back $7.5M with the previous day is notable)
   - Oct 11, 2021: $1.0M — what was this for?
   - Oct 16, 2021: $1.4M — what was this for?
4. **If corporate wallets:** Provide a complete breakdown of outflows (payroll, vendors, infrastructure, legal, etc.)
5. **If personal wallets:** Why were corporate funds sent to personal wallets? What was the justification?

#### DeFi Positions — $9.78M in Losses (Allegations 95–97)
6. **Were the DeFi positions authorized?** Was there a treasury management policy? A board resolution? An investment committee?
7. **Who made the decision** to deploy funds into Mochi Protocol ($6.51M), Neutrino USDN ($345K), CVX/ETH pools ($3.27M), and Maple Finance ($780K)?
8. **Was the board informed** of these DeFi positions before the losses occurred?
9. **Were these DeFi positions entered from corporate wallets or personal wallets?** (If from personal wallets — meaning you moved corporate money to personal wallets then deployed it into DeFi — that is extremely difficult to defend.)

#### Hardware Wallet Claim (Allegation 99)
10. **Did you tell investors $22M was in a hardware wallet + $2M in multi-sig?** If yes: when, to whom, in what context?
11. **What was the actual wallet balance at the time you made the $22M claim?**
12. **Timeline:** Did the DeFi deployments and the $16.6M transfers happen BEFORE or AFTER you made the $22M claim? If before, you told investors money was safe when it was already gone or deployed in risky DeFi.

### 🔴🔴 CRITICAL PRIORITY — Answer Before Next Filing

#### Exchange Accounts & Token Listings (Allegations 67–76)
13. **Were the HTX and KuCoin accounts corporate or personal?** In whose names were they registered? The complaint claims they were in Schwarzer's, Xin Jin's, and Jin's personal names. If exchanges in 2021 required individual KYC even for corporate accounts, that explains the "personal" framing — but we need documentation.
14. **What was the purpose of the 550M tokens sent to exchanges?** (300M to HTX + 250M to KuCoin) — Liquidity provision? Market maker inventory? Exchange staking programs? What was the corporate decision and who authorized it?
15. **What was the purpose of the $41.78M in USDT conversions?** Was this: (a) standard liquidity provision for exchange listing, (b) market-making operations, (c) operational treasury management, or (d) personal liquidation?
16. **Who operated the "market maker accounts" on these exchanges?** Gotbit? Cere directly? Individuals?
17. **Where did net proceeds go** after market-making operations? Corporate treasury? Interdata? Personal wallets?
18. **The 3 "laundering wallets" (Allegation 76) — $26.39M:** What are these wallets? Identify them and explain their purpose.

#### Money Flow Chain (Allegations 82–83)
19. **Explain each hop in the money flow chain with documentation:**
   - Exchange accounts (in personal names) → Why personal names? KYC requirement?
   - → Interdata (BVI) → Standard token issuer receipt?
   - → **Opendata Network Foundation (Panama)** → ⚠️ WHAT IS THIS ENTITY? When formed? Purpose? **This entity is NOT in any of our prior defense documents.** If it's real, explain it. If it's misidentified, correct the record.
   - → Cerebellum (DE) → Operating company receiving operational funds — OK
   - → BNW Network GmbH (Germany) → What EU operations justified this transfer?
20. **Can you provide bank statements or transfer records** documenting the business purpose of each inter-entity transfer?

#### Gotbit Relationship (Allegations 5, 84–86)
21. **Did Cere have a contract with Gotbit?** If yes: scope, dates, terms, and whether it preceded Gotbit's legal issues.
22. **Provide the actual Gotbit contract** — we need to see the authorized activities, fees, and terms.
