## 1. AI Lead Engineer

**Twitter Card Headline:** AI at 100TB+ scale across decentralized networks

### Variation A — "Hot take" (LIVE)
> hot take: the most interesting AI work isn't at foundation model labs rn. it's at the infra layer — making models actually work across decentralized networks at 100TB+ scale. if you read this and went "that's my thing" 👀

### Variation B — "What if..."
> what if the bottleneck for AI isn't better models — it's that we're still running them on centralized infra that wasn't built for this? someone has to fix the plumbing. we're looking for that someone. 🔧

### Variation C — Short & punchy
> everyone's building AI models. almost nobody is solving how to run them across decentralized infra at real scale. we need the person who sees that gap 👀

## 2. Principal Software Engineer

**Twitter Card Headline:** Build the decentralized data cloud from the ground up

### Variation A — "Hot take"
> hot take: the best infrastructure engineers alive right now aren't at FAANG. they're at places where "figure it out" is the entire job description. rust, go, distributed systems, no training wheels. that's where the craft lives.

### Variation B — "What if..."
> what if the next AWS wasn't a company — it was a protocol? building a decentralized data cloud from scratch in rust/go. need a principal eng who's allergic to duct-tape architecture. you know who you are 🛠️

### Variation C — Short & punchy
> decentralized data cloud. rust & go. distributed systems at scale. no hand-holding, no legacy code. just hard problems. interested? 👀

## 3. Blockchain Engineer

**Twitter Card Headline:** Smart contracts & L1/L2 infra for decentralized data

### Variation A — "Hot take"
> hot take: most blockchain engineering jobs are just copy-pasting solidity templates and calling it innovation. the actual hard stuff? building L1/L2 infra that handles real data workloads — not just token swaps. that's the work worth doing.

### Variation B — "What if..."
> what if decentralized storage actually worked at scale — not as a whitepaper, but as infra people depend on? substrate, solidity, smart contracts that do more than move tokens. if you build at that layer, let's talk 🧱

### Variation C — Short & punchy
> substrate. solidity. L1/L2. building a decentralized data cloud — not another DeFi fork. if that distinction matters to you, check this out 👀

## 4. Founder's Associate (Business Ops)

**Twitter Card Headline:** Work directly with a Silicon Valley veteran CEO

### Variation A — "Hot take"
> hot take: the most underrated career accelerator isn't an MBA or a FAANG stint. it's being the right hand to a founder who's done it before. you learn more in 6 months than most people do in 5 years. and yes — one of those roles just opened.

### Variation B — "What if..."
> what if instead of climbing a corporate ladder for 10 years, you spent 2 years working directly with a SV-veteran CEO on strategy, ops, and BD at a web3 company scaling globally? that path exists rn. just saying 🤷

### Variation C — Short & punchy
> strategy, ops, BD — reporting directly to a silicon valley veteran CEO. if you want the founder track without founding, this is it.

---

## 5. AI Innovator

**Twitter Card Headline:** Ship production AI — concept to deployment, no ceiling

### Variation A — "Hot take"
> hot take: the AI talent gap isn't "people who can use ChatGPT." it's people who've shipped real AI in production — concept to deployment, no handoffs, no excuses. if you've done that and want a higher ceiling, you should see what we're building 🚀

### Variation B — "What if..."
> what if you stopped optimizing AI for someone else's roadmap and got to build the whole thing yourself — concept to prod, your call? looking for the kind of AI builder who ships first and writes the blog post never.

### Variation C — Short & punchy
> shipped production AI? bored of incremental improvements? high ceiling, zero bureaucracy, real problems. this might be your move 👀
