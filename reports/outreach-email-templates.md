## Template 1: AI Lead Engineer / AI Innovator

**Subject:** `infra problems > model problems`

```
Hey {firstName},

Saw your work on {relevantProject/repo}. Quick question — have you thought about what happens when AI models need to run across decentralized infrastructure at real scale?

That's what we're building at Cere (now CEF AI). Decentralized data cloud, AI inference at the edge, 100TB+ workloads. The infra layer that makes distributed AI actually work.

Not asking you to apply to anything. Just think it's the kind of problem you'd find interesting.

## Template 2: Principal Software Engineer

**Subject:** `rust + distributed systems + no duct tape`

```
Hey {firstName},

Your contributions to {repo} caught my eye. We're building something that might scratch the same itch — a decentralized data cloud from scratch in Rust/Go.

No legacy code. No "migrate the monolith." Just hard distributed systems problems with real scale requirements.

Cere Network (CEF AI) is the company. Small team, massive ambition, actual ownership of the architecture.

Worth a look? https://join.com/companies/cefai/15490514-principal-software-engineer

## Template 3: Blockchain Engineer

**Subject:** `substrate ≠ another DeFi fork`

```
Hey {firstName},

I know "blockchain engineer" emails usually mean "we need someone to fork Uniswap." This is not that.

We're building decentralized data infrastructure on Substrate/Polkadot — smart contracts and L1/L2 infra that handles real data workloads, not just token swaps. Your {substrate/solidity} experience is exactly what this needs.

If that distinction matters to you: https://join.com/companies/cefai/15552633-blockchain-engineer

## Template 4: Founder's Associate

**Subject:** `2 years > 10 years on a ladder`

```
Hey {firstName},

Most "chief of staff" or "associate" roles are just glorified project management. This one isn't.

Working directly with our CEO (SV veteran, multiple exits) on strategy, ops, and BD as we scale globally. Web3 + AI intersection. Berlin or SF based.

The kind of role where you learn more in 6 months than most people do in 5 years.

Interested? https://join.com/companies/cefai/15552421-founder-s-associate-business-ops

## Template Guidelines

1. **Personalize the first line** — reference their actual work (GitHub, LinkedIn, blog)
2. **Keep it under 150 words** — respect their time
3. **No "Dear Hiring Manager" energy** — write like a human
4. **One clear CTA** — a single link, not 5 options
5. **No follow-up sequence yet** — one email, see if it lands
6. **Send from a person, not a brand** — use Mart's or team member's email
