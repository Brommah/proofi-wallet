## Outreach Strategy

### 🟢 HIGH Priority — Act Now
1. **Personalize heavily** — reference their specific OSS contributions and repos
2. **Lead with impact** — "your work on X is exactly what we're building"
3. **Web3/crypto angle** — if they have blockchain background, emphasize decentralized AI
4. **Founder-to-builder** — if freelance/indie, pitch mission + equity
5. **No-company profiles** — likely open to opportunities, move fast

### 🟡 MEDIUM Priority — Strategic Outreach  
1. **HuggingFace/LangChain folks** — "take your OSS work to production at scale"
2. **Mid-size company** — pitch more autonomy, ownership, and impact
3. **EU candidates** — mention EU-friendly remote, Berlin/Amsterdam presence
4. **Red Hat/IBM engineers** — pitch startup speed vs enterprise bureaucracy

### ⚪ LOW Priority — Nurture
1. **Passive approach** — engage on GitHub first, build relationship
2. **Community building** — invite to events, hackathons, Discord
3. **Long game** — these may become available when their current company does layoffs
